      <description>I took a trip outside of the US for the first time in 1999. My sister and I got to spend a week in Paris, then took a train to the Netherlands where we toured the country for another week with a friend. Traveling so far from home by ourselves was exciting enough, and being in the most beautiful and metropolitan city in the world turned it into an unforgettable experience.</description>

      <description>On our last day in Peru, our flight from Cusco wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be until 15h30. Until then we could either wander around Cusco or use our Boleto Turístico to explore the other ruins on the outskirts of Cusco (Puca Pucara, Q&amp;rsquo;enqo and Tambomachay). However, we had heard really good things about Ollantaytambo. As it turned out, when we returned from Machu Picchu the night before, Lima Tours sent a driver to pick us up at Ollantaytambo.</description>

      <description>Map of our hike to Intipunku, the Inca Bridge and down to Aguas Calientes (the GPS track recorded by the logger is a little out of sync with Google Map, but you get the idea).
Had Machu Picchu been built in Cusco, it would have been just as spectacular. But being perched on a remote mountaintop, invisible from below, covered by swirling mists, and (when &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; by Hiram Bingham) overrun by the jungle gives it an unmatched mystique.</description>

      <description>The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city. It&amp;rsquo;s believed that the Incas built the city of Cusco in the shape of a jaguar, with Sacsayhuamán representing the head (and the most formidable part) of the jaguar. It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.</description>

      <description>Map of our walking route of Písac.
Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.</description>

      <description>We arrived at airport with just 1 hour to spare. I am quite impressed with LAN Chile Airline. Plenty of professional bilingual staff are available to assist passengers at automated check-in kiosks. Oh and they&amp;rsquo;re all attractive young women. In other parts of the world some old traditions still persist. Our flight to Cusco was short, about 1h. Our Peruvian fellow passenger was nice enough to stick the my GPS receiver behind the window shade so that we get a GPS trace of the flight path.</description>

      <description>Our Peru adventure didn&amp;rsquo;t start out well. Our flight from Boston was delayed for 90 min and managed to land in Newark 5 minutes after the connection had already left. We were rerouted to Miami and put on a flight to Lima that arrived at 4:30 in the morning. The streets were mostly devoid of traffic though surprisingly some street sweepers were out working. Leaving the airport we scurried through a warren of narrow streets not unlike San Jose, Costa Rica, but soon things opened up when we got on the highway that runs along the ocean.</description>

      <title>Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain</title>

      <description>Map of our round-trip hike to Dorr Mountain from Sieur de Monts.
Dorr Mountain is the second highest peak on Mount Desert Island, behind only Cadillac Mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s named after George Dorr, who&amp;rsquo;s affectionately known as the father of Acadia National Park. There are multiple paths to the summit. We chose to start from Sieur de Monts spring.
There are a couple of trails crisscrossing the area. The most obvious is Emery Path, which begins right behind the small visitors&#39; center.</description>

      <title>Acadia National Park: Cadillac Mountain</title>
      <link>https://yentran.org/post/2012-07-08-acadia-national-park-cadillac-mountain/</link>

      <description>The tallest peak in Acadia and the first place in the continental US to see the morning light, Cadillac Mountain is also the most accessible &amp;ndash; you can just drive there. Nevertheless, its popularity doesn&amp;rsquo;t detract from its appeal. Unfortunately we couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it here early enough for sunrise, being worn out from hiking every day. So we had to settle for the &amp;ldquo;other golden hour&amp;rdquo;. Fortunately with a storm brewing in the distance all afternoon, we were treated to a beautiful sunset.</description>

      <description>Map of our hike on the North and South Bubble Mountains
When seen from a distance, it&amp;rsquo;s immediately obvious why the Bubbles are so named, though I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can think of more colorful analogies. Located just a short distance from the Park Loop Road and the popular Jordan Pond, they&amp;rsquo;re some of the most accessible climbs in the park. Both offer splendid views of Jordan Pond and, in the distance, the islands off the southern coast of Mount Desert Island.</description>

      <title>Acadia National Park: Biking the carriage roads</title>

      <description>Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads. Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior. These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle.</description>

      <description>Map of our hike on Gorham Mountain Trail.
Because it&amp;rsquo;s the only national park in the northeastern US, I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Acadia National Park several times over the years. But I&amp;rsquo;m a bit mystified that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to hike it just once, and it was only last year. I think it is because I&amp;rsquo;ve come here in a large group, for which it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to plan a hike. Further, there are so many things to do that we&amp;rsquo;ve always managed to find other alternatives.</description>

      <description>Some highlights during my visit to the Berkshires in the autumn of 2010:
The Cascade (map): Trail head begins at the end of a very suburban road. Very limited street parking (think 2-3 spaces, depending on the skills of the driver). A short hike takes you over a nice wooden bridge as well as a fallen log-bridge. The waterfalls drops into a shallow pool at the trail.
Mount Greylock summit (map): The foliage on Mount Greylock was past-peak when we were there.</description>

      <description>Last morning in Québec. We took a 5-minute walk to check out the cool murals we saw earlier. These are quite amazing. A Gothic church exterior. An ornate stained-glass interior with a mysterious figure hooded in black. A ancient Aztec-meet-Egyptian structure surrounded by jungle. The best one yet was a castle with a red dragon, unfortunately obscured by the scaffolding for the Cirque de Soleil. I think you&amp;rsquo;d agree that these undoubtedly are the coolest highway underpasses anywhere.</description>

      <description>We decided to take off around 16:00 on Friday. In addition to the rush hour, we anticipated no fewer than 100000 Bostonians to be on the move for the long weekend. So we avoided the main highways altogether. Our plans worked, and when we re-connected with Interstate-93 North it was in Manchester, NH, some 60 miles away. The drive through the magnificent White Mountains was quite pleasant, as usual. Nevertheless, it was to be a very long drive.</description>

      <description>At breakfast we ran into another Belgian couple, this time from Antwerp. They were on a tour of Ontario and Québec. They were quite excited about a free outdoor performance of the Cirque de Soleil. Sophie, who made us breakfast, also told us about the Moulin de l&amp;rsquo;Images, which was some sort of projection. We&amp;rsquo;d have to check both of them out.
We escaped from warm and muggy Boston to somewhat warm and muggy Québec.</description>

      <description>We had our fill of the city yesterday, so it seemed like time to head out to the country. We also learned that William and Kate would be in town as part of their Canada tour, an event undoubtedly to be attended by legions of their admirers and non-admirers alike. That cemented the decision for us. First stop is the Montmorency Falls. At 84 meters, it&amp;rsquo;s higher than Niagara Falls.</description>

      <description>I lay awake at night pondering how we were going to see more critters. As it turned out, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to leave the hotel.
Tilajari Resort sits right on the bank of the San Carlos River. We woke up to the chattering sounds of birds. As we ambled to breakfast we could see the brown river glimmering just beyond a gently sloping lawn. The fruit section at breakfast was par excellence.</description>

      <description>Breakfast included blackberry and papaya juice. I love this place! We bid farewell to our avian and reptilian friends. There was some commotion on the other side of the dining hall. Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&amp;rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&amp;rsquo;s tour leader.</description>

      <description>Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&amp;rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.</description>

      <description>We went down to breakfast and ran into the Coopers. They had survived the trip from Arenal after all. However, this would be the last time that we saw them.
 Alan the entomologist at Monteverde Butterfly Garden  First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;crazy biologist guy&amp;rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.</description>

      <description>The flight was to be at 13:00 so we planned on departing no later than 10:30. That left us about 1h after breakfast to explore downtown San Jose. We were 4 blocks away from the Jade Museum, which owns the largest collection of Pre-Columbian jade artifacts anywhere. Unfortunately a museum was out of the question given the time constraint.
Parque Morazán There are quite a few pleasant green spaces which serve to provide respite in the brick and concrete jungle.</description>

      <description>Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&amp;rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&amp;rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&amp;rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.</description>

      <description>I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago. This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.
After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).</description>
