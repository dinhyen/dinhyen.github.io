      I took a trip outside of the US for the first time in 1999. My sister and I got to spend a week in Paris, then took a train to the Netherlands where we toured the country for another week with a friend. Traveling so far from home by ourselves was exciting enough, and being in the most beautiful and metropolitan city in the world turned it into an unforgettable experience.

      On our last day in Peru, our flight from Cusco wouldn&rsquo;t be until 15h30. Until then we could either wander around Cusco or use our Boleto Turístico to explore the other ruins on the outskirts of Cusco (Puca Pucara, Q&rsquo;enqo and Tambomachay). However, we had heard really good things about Ollantaytambo. As it turned out, when we returned from Machu Picchu the night before, Lima Tours sent a driver to pick us up at Ollantaytambo.

Had Machu Picchu been built in Cusco, it would have been just as spectacular. But being perched on a remote mountaintop, invisible from below, covered by swirling mists, and (when &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by Hiram Bingham) overrun by the jungle gives it an unmatched mystique.

      The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city. It&rsquo;s believed that the Incas built the city of Cusco in the shape of a jaguar, with Sacsayhuamán representing the head (and the most formidable part) of the jaguar. It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.

Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

      We arrived at airport with just 1 hour to spare. I am quite impressed with LAN Chile Airline. Plenty of professional bilingual staff are available to assist passengers at automated check-in kiosks. Oh and they&rsquo;re all attractive young women. In other parts of the world some old traditions still persist. Our flight to Cusco was short, about 1h. Our Peruvian fellow passenger was nice enough to stick the my GPS receiver behind the window shade so that we get a GPS trace of the flight path.

      Our Peru adventure didn&rsquo;t start out well. Our flight from Boston was delayed for 90 min and managed to land in Newark 5 minutes after the connection had already left. We were rerouted to Miami and put on a flight to Lima that arrived at 4:30 in the morning. The streets were mostly devoid of traffic though surprisingly some street sweepers were out working. Leaving the airport we scurried through a warren of narrow streets not unlike San Jose, Costa Rica, but soon things opened up when we got on the highway that runs along the ocean.

      Some highlights during my visit to the Berkshires in the autumn of 2010:
The Cascade (map): Trail head begins at the end of a very suburban road. Very limited street parking (think 2-3 spaces, depending on the skills of the driver). A short hike takes you over a nice wooden bridge as well as a fallen log-bridge. The waterfalls drops into a shallow pool at the trail.
Mount Greylock summit (map): The foliage on Mount Greylock was past-peak when we were there.

      Last morning in Québec. We took a 5-minute walk to check out the cool murals we saw earlier. These are quite amazing. A Gothic church exterior. An ornate stained-glass interior with a mysterious figure hooded in black. A ancient Aztec-meet-Egyptian structure surrounded by jungle. The best one yet was a castle with a red dragon, unfortunately obscured by the scaffolding for the Cirque de Soleil. I think you&rsquo;d agree that these undoubtedly are the coolest highway underpasses anywhere.

      We decided to take off around 16:00 on Friday. In addition to the rush hour, we anticipated no fewer than 100000 Bostonians to be on the move for the long weekend. So we avoided the main highways altogether. Our plans worked, and when we re-connected with Interstate-93 North it was in Manchester, NH, some 60 miles away. The drive through the magnificent White Mountains was quite pleasant, as usual. Nevertheless, it was to be a very long drive.

They were quite excited about a free outdoor performance of the Cirque de Soleil. Sophie, who made us breakfast, also told us about the Moulin de l&rsquo;Images, which was some sort of projection. We&rsquo;d have to check both of them out.
We escaped from warm and muggy Boston to somewhat warm and muggy Québec.

That cemented the decision for us. First stop is the Montmorency Falls. At 84 meters, it&rsquo;s higher than Niagara Falls.

      In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy biologist guy&rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.

After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

      Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.
