      <title>Sacsayhuamán, Peru (Day 4)</title>

      <description>The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city. It&amp;rsquo;s believed that the Incas built the city of Cusco in the shape of a jaguar, with Sacsayhuamán representing the head (and the most formidable part) of the jaguar. It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.</description>

      <title>Revere Beach sand sculptures</title>

      <description>The annual Revere Beach sculpting festival concluded over the weekend. But since it hadn&amp;rsquo;t rained, we figured there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the sculptures were still around. We got there around twilight, which was even better because the absence of mid-day shadows allowed the subtle details of the sculptures to come out.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park.
Not sure what this represents, other than a study in perspectives.
The rather grotesque and provocatively Lovecraftian gorehound.</description>

      <title>Acadia National Park: Biking the carriage roads</title>

      <description>Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads. Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior. These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle.</description>

      <title>The Reformatory Branch Trail</title>

      <description>Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable, because it&amp;rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&amp;rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.</description>

      <title>Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary</title>

      <description>Broadmoor is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary. Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&amp;rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet. Despite sounding like something out of The Hounds of the Baskervilles, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River. In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.
Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.</description>

      <title>Hub on Wheels 2010</title>

      <description>Every September since 2005, the city of Boston has held a charity bike ride to benefit of one of its educational programs. The event is called Hub on Wheels, a clever pun based on Boston&amp;rsquo;s modest nickname for itself, the Hub of the Universe. For the majority of riders, it would be the only time of the year that they get an intimate view of some of Boston&amp;rsquo;s lesser-known neighborhoods. There are 3 available courses, 10-, 30- and 50-mile.</description>

      <title>Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge</title>

      <description>File this as another in the category of &amp;ldquo;places I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&amp;rdquo;. This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike. The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &amp;ldquo;the shot heard around the world&amp;rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road. On a nice day, you&amp;rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.</description>

      <title>The Audubon Habitat sanctuary</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been discovering more and more of the amazing gems that are the Audubon sanctuaries. Recently I visited the Ipswich River sanctuary and the Broadmoor sanctuary, both of which are amazing for the scenery and wildlife they contain. Yet I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner. The Habitat sanctuary is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.</description>

      <title>Marblehead meander</title>

      <description>We discovered Marblehead sort of by accident. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it from an obscure television series in the late-80s called Marblehead Manor, which happened to star the then-equally obscure Michael Richards. One weekend we decided that it was too early to call it a night, so we took off on a drive out of Boston in a general northeasterly direction. We found ourselves at Revere Beach, which was deserted, and continued on Route 1A north to Lynn.</description>
