      <title>Revere Beach sand sculptures</title>

      <description>The annual Revere Beach sculpting festival concluded over the weekend. But since it hadn&amp;rsquo;t rained, we figured there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the sculptures were still around. We got there around twilight, which was even better because the absence of mid-day shadows allowed the subtle details of the sculptures to come out.
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park.
Not sure what this represents, other than a study in perspectives.
The rather grotesque and provocatively Lovecraftian gorehound.</description>

      <title>The Reformatory Branch Trail</title>

      <description>Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable, because it&amp;rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&amp;rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.</description>

      <title>Berkshires 2010</title>

      <description>Some highlights during my visit to the Berkshires in the autumn of 2010:
The Cascade (map): Trail head begins at the end of a very suburban road. Very limited street parking (think 2-3 spaces, depending on the skills of the driver). A short hike takes you over a nice wooden bridge as well as a fallen log-bridge. The waterfalls drops into a shallow pool at the trail.
Mount Greylock summit (map): The foliage on Mount Greylock was past-peak when we were there.</description>

Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.</description>

      <title>Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary</title>

      <description>Broadmoor is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary. Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&amp;rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet. Despite sounding like something out of The Hounds of the Baskervilles, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River. In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.
Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.</description>

      <title>Hiking Mount Monadnock</title>

      <description>As far as big mountain goes,[ Mount Monadnock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock&amp;quot; targtet=&amp;quot;_blank) in the southwestern corner of New Hampshire is relatively close to Boston. Despite its proximity, we&amp;rsquo;ve never set foot on it. So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&amp;rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.</description>

      <title>Hiking Mount Misery</title>

      <description>We went for a short hike over the long Labor Day weekend. To get there we drove through very picturesque Lincoln Center. Note to self: come back here for a bike ride in the fall. The trail head is located at the back of the very unremarkable parking lot for the local commuter train station.
Despite its formidable and romantic name, Mount Misery is anything but. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively small hill which barely rises above the tree line.</description>

      <title>The doors of Boston</title>

      <description>Some time ago I saw a poster of doors. No, not these doors. I decided that I wanted one for myself. I picked Beacon Hill, a historic neighborhood known for its elegant houses and stately mansions. I biked around at dusk purposely so that the lights would be on, stopped frequently and snapped away. Some people, predictably, were wary of a stranger taking pictures of their homes. However, once I explained what I was doing, they were quite understanding.</description>

      <title>Hub on Wheels 2010</title>

      <description>Every September since 2005, the city of Boston has held a charity bike ride to benefit of one of its educational programs. The event is called Hub on Wheels, a clever pun based on Boston&amp;rsquo;s modest nickname for itself, the Hub of the Universe. For the majority of riders, it would be the only time of the year that they get an intimate view of some of Boston&amp;rsquo;s lesser-known neighborhoods. There are 3 available courses, 10-, 30- and 50-mile.</description>

      <title>Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge</title>

      <description>File this as another in the category of &amp;ldquo;places I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&amp;rdquo;. This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike. The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &amp;ldquo;the shot heard around the world&amp;rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road. On a nice day, you&amp;rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.</description>

      <description>Every season in Boston has its own riveting appeal. The fall is not only the most beautiful of seasons, but it also marks the start of the hockey season and, for non-hockey fans, the annual Head of the Charles Regatta. In 2010, the Regatta took place on a chilly weekend in late October (this was Boston, after all). For me, there was nothing better than to put on a warm jacket, hop on the bike for the half-hour ride to Harvard University, then snap away.</description>

      <title>The Audubon Habitat sanctuary</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been discovering more and more of the amazing gems that are the Audubon sanctuaries. Recently I visited the Ipswich River sanctuary and the Broadmoor sanctuary, both of which are amazing for the scenery and wildlife they contain. Yet I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner. The Habitat sanctuary is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.</description>

      <title>Marblehead meander</title>

      <description>We discovered Marblehead sort of by accident. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it from an obscure television series in the late-80s called Marblehead Manor, which happened to star the then-equally obscure Michael Richards. One weekend we decided that it was too early to call it a night, so we took off on a drive out of Boston in a general northeasterly direction. We found ourselves at Revere Beach, which was deserted, and continued on Route 1A north to Lynn.</description>

      <title>Spring forward</title>

      <description>Winter dragged its feel longer than usual this year. The first day of spring came and went, yet the dreariness continued well into April. There was even a minor snow storm on April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day, bringing to mind the epic blizzard of 1997. I remember that one well, having worked through the night to finish a problem set, only to find that class had been canceled and normally busy Memorial Drive had turned into a white graveyard.</description>
