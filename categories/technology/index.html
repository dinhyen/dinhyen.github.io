      Octopress instructions are for setting up a new repo; i.e. by running rake setup_github_pages. It doesn’t work if you’ve cloned an existing repo.
You have to manually set up a git repository in the _deploy directory which should track the master branch of the repo on GitHub.
# create new deploy dir rm -rf _deploy mkdir _deploy cd _deploy # initialize empty git repo git init git remote add origin git@github.

        Validating multiple fields with Angular
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Angular makes it simple to validate a single form field. Validating multiple fields requires a bit more work. The approach that works for me is use a directive to lay out the framework, but to perform the actual validation in the parent scope. Since the user defines the specifics of the validation, any arbitrary validation can be performed and the directive can be kept simple.
In this example, I&rsquo;d like to validate that the sum of 2 text inputs equals 10.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Two things can happen when the user fills out a form field: the entered value is incorrect or the value is missing. With Angular validating either case is consistent and simple. The issue is when to show the error message: as the value is being entered, after the field loses focus or after the user submits the form. I think that for a better usability, the user should be informed that the value is incorrect while entering the value.

      Have a problem with Angular scope variable binding not working on a Jekyll or Octopress (which uses Jekyll) page? It so happens that Jekyll&rsquo;s Liquid Template uses the same {{ foo }} syntax as Angular and would attempt to process the markup before Angular can get to it. To get around the problem, you can surround Angular markup with {% raw %}and {% endraw %}tags. Alternatively, you can also forgo from using this syntax altogether and use Angular&rsquo;s ng-bind directive to bind a variable to a DOM element.

      Copying files somewhere is pretty standard procedure when deploying an app. Interestingly I&rsquo;ve never had to copy files directly in Hudson.

Now that I want to deploy Angular and other client apps in Hudson, I&rsquo;d have to copy the files manually.
My initial attempt was to add a new Execute Shell build step to run xcopy.

      Angular makes it simple to create standard index and details views. Using the ubiquitous task list as an example, I can set up routes using the $route service as follows:
$routeProvider .when(&#39;/tasks&#39;, { templateUrl: &#39;_tasks.html&#39;, controller: &#39;TasksIndexCtrl&#39; }) .when(&#39;/task/:id&#39;, { templateUrl: &#39;_task.html&#39;, controller: &#39;TaskDetailsCtrl&#39; }) .otherwise({ redirectTo: &#39;/tasks&#39; }); } The routes definitions specify the Angular controller and HTML template to use when the user navigates to a particular path. Here we have 2 controllers, one for the index page and one for the details page.

It seems like I&rsquo;m always working on search boxes, but here goes another. My goal here is to display an icon inside the search box. Initially, the search box has a dark background. When clicked, the background changes to white. The icon should changes its color based on whether or not the search box has focus. If we were using a font-based icon such as Fontawesome, which is awesome by the way, styling the icon would be a simple exercise.

We&rsquo;re gradually gravitating toward AngularJS because it&rsquo;s more powerful and flexible. However with AngularJS we have some issues with IE7, which unfortunately we&rsquo;re stuck supporting. So when I want to add some simple enhancements to the search box, I went back to KnockoutJS. For a simple scenario such as this, KnockoutJS works great. If we had to do this using plain jQuery, we&rsquo;d have to juggle keypress, focus and blur events which is just unnecessary drudgery!

KnockoutJS is a dynamic UI framework that can really liberate you from the tedium of low-level DOM manipulations. Even though I&rsquo;ve only played with it for a little while, I&rsquo;ve become a huge fan. One of my initial attempts is to create an animated text input similar to Twitter&rsquo;s.
The UI is quite simple. The textbox should display a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; prompt. When the user clicks inside the textbox, expand it and display a save button, initially disabled.

With the software installed, I was able to configure Wifi afterward.

        Modifying SQL Server table without dropping and recreating it

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The SQL Server Designer is a nice visual tool for making modifications to a table. However, when you save the changes, SQL Server actually drops the entire table and then recreates it (if there are data in the table, they would be retained). This happens even if the changes made do not actually require that the table be re-created. This is presumably so that SQL Server can accommodate all possible types of modification.

      I tried out a well-known cloud-based antivirus solution. It worked well enough, but after I installed it, I noticed that my FireFox searches were now redirected from Google to Yahoo!.

        Upgrading the HTC Aria with Android Gingerbread and CyanogenMod

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I have an HTC Aria which runs now-ancient Android 2.1. This phone is far from being the latest and greatest, to put it mildly, but I like its small form factor. After putting up with it for a year, I have had enough and decided to upgrade it to Gingerbread. This is how I did it. As this is my first attempt, no doubt there are different and better ways to do things.

      In Visual Studio, it&rsquo;s easy enough to turn on and off line numbers. You&rsquo;ll have to select Tools &gt; Options &gt; Text Editor, expand the language of choice, select General, then toggle Line numbers under the Display section. This can get tedious if you want to be able to show and hide line numbers at will. To turn this process into a single click, you can record custom macros to show and hide line numbers.

      We&rsquo;re using MSBuild in Hudson as part of our continuous integration process. We put the MSBuild scripts in the same directory as the Visual Studio solution file. Everything has been working well until until we decided, as an experiment, to put the MSBuild scripts in a separate directory from the solution. Then the build process started to fail with error MSB3202, &ldquo;the project file was not found&rdquo;.
By using MSBuild&rsquo;s &ldquo;/verbosity:diagnostic&rdquo; flag, we were able to look at the list of properties that MSBuild was using.

      We&rsquo;re using AutoMapper in ASP.NET MVC automate the mapping of properties between entity and view model objects. This is a highly useful tool which helps us avoid the tedium of having to assigning properties manually. Here&rsquo;s a good introduction to using AutoMapper.
In one case, I find that the AutoMapper doesn&rsquo;t work for all properties. One property in particular doesn&rsquo;t get mapped. If I manually assign a value to it as a test, I would get a ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException.

      Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.
Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account.

      My computer got a dose of malware today. The trojan got a hold of my USB drive. It made all of my files and folders hidden, then injected executables with the same names. It also hid the .exe extension so that the executables appeared in place of the legitimate objects they were masquerading. It gave the fake folders the right icon so that they looked just like folders. The objective is to fool the user into double-clicking the folders to open them but instead executing the trojan.

      The ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 motherboard is a little long in the tooth but still quite capable. Mine has been running Windows XP Media Center Edition for some time and I decided to upgrade it to Windows 7. The challenge is that the motherboard&rsquo;s JMicron SATA2 chipset isn&rsquo;t detected automatically at installation. If you want to install Windows on a SATA hard drive, you will have to load the driver first. The other problem is that, as of the time of writing, there is no Windows 7 driver for the ULi integrated Ethernet controller due to the age of the hardware.
