      <description>Map of our hike on the Great Head Trail.
Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high.</description>

      <description>Map of our hike on Jesup Path.
Along with [Emery Path](http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/acadia-national-park-dorr-mountain/&amp;quot; title=&amp;ldquo;Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain), Jesup Path is another trail which can be found at the Sieur de Monts spring area. Straight and level, it&amp;rsquo;s hardly a challenging hike. Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.
