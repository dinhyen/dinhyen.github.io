      <description>With laser printer, scanner, Ethernet and Wifi interface rolled into one, the Brother HL-2280DW is quite a little champ. However, for me, getting the Wifi to work was a bit of a challenge. The installer would die silently after configuring Wifi but without having installed the software. After some trial and error, I was able to successfully install for Ethernet . With the software installed, I was able to configure Wifi afterward.</description>
