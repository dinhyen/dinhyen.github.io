Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.</description>

      <description>In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&amp;rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.</description>
