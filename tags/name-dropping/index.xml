      <description>Since 1999 I&amp;rsquo;ve helped run a pickup hockey group at the Skating Club of Boston. We&amp;rsquo;re really not crazy about the rink there. The ice is intended for figure skaters so it&amp;rsquo;s soft and thus slow and quick to become choppy. There is no glass above the boards so if you shoot high enough you&amp;rsquo;d have to go fish for the puck under the stands. And since figure skaters generally stay in the middle of the ice, the edges are neglected and not well maintained; this is a problem if you try to &amp;ldquo;wrap the puck around the board&amp;rdquo;.</description>
