      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get a Wix installer to work. This particular scenario is pretty simple. I want to configure the database via a custom action, then start a Windows service which then queries the database before starting. This would seem like a commonplace scenario. However, Wix documentations are sparse and I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrangling with this for some time. I finally found a solution. While I loathe to reference a StackOverflow answer, as a favor to my future self I&amp;rsquo;m going to do so anyways.</description>

      <description>Batch files are the last resort due to its Neanderthal abilities and exasperating syntax. But if I want to run a bunch of things on bare-boned Windows Server 2003, this seems like the quickest if not only option.
I tried something like this, by creating a property for the system executable cmd.exe, which would execute the batch script via the /c switch. Then I created a custom action that relies on the property.</description>
