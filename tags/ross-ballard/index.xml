      <description>Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&amp;rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.</description>
