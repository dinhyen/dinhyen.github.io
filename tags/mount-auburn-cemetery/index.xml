Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.</description>
