      <description>George RR Martin&amp;rsquo;s Song of Ice and Fire series receives almost universal acclaim from reviewers. I picked up A Game of Thrones after seeing it recommended by several reviewers. Since it is billed as the entry into an epic fantasy series, I half-expected to see a fantastic world populated by magic wielders and magical creations. Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin&amp;rsquo;s medieval universe.</description>
