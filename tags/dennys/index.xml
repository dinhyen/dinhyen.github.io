      <description>I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago. This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.
After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someoneÂ the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).</description>
