      <description>I wanted to upgrade a couple of PCs by replacing the motherboard (by the way, when buying PC components, if there&amp;rsquo;s a Microcenter store nearby, try it first; at the time of this writing their $50 bundle discount for a motherboard-CPU combo cannot be beat, even by much-loved online enthusiast stores). Afterwards, I found that Windows 7 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t boot.
In my prior experience, Windows would automatically detect the new motherboard and reconfigure itself accordingly.</description>

      <description>With laser printer, scanner, Ethernet and Wifi interface rolled into one, the Brother HL-2280DW is quite a little champ. However, for me, getting the Wifi to work was a bit of a challenge. The installer would die silently after configuring Wifi but without having installed the software. After some trial and error, I was able to successfully install for Ethernet . With the software installed, I was able to configure Wifi afterward.</description>
