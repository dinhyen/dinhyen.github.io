      <title>A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3) by George R.R. Martin</title>

      <description>With this third hit in a row, I think it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&amp;rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.</description>

      <title>Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time series, Book 10) by Robert Jordan</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&amp;rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.</description>

      <title>Destiny: Child of the Sky by Elizabeth Haydon</title>

      <description>2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&amp;rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&amp;rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.</description>

      <title>Dragons of Autumn Twilight (Dragonlance Chronicles, Volume I) by Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman</title>

      <description>The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.</description>

      <description>After the setback at the end of book two, hope finally dawns on Krynn. For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat.</description>

      <description>The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&amp;rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters.</description>

      <title>Faith of the Fallen (Sword of Truth series, Book 6) by Terry Goodkind</title>

      <description>Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society.</description>

      <description>I was attracted to Rhapsody, the first book of the Rhapsody trilogy, by way of its critical acclaim as one of the best fantasy debut in years. The book does not disappoint. It&amp;rsquo;s a marvellously executed masterpiece of high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien that we all know and love. The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist.</description>

      <description>This book is perhaps a let-down from the enthralling Temple of the Winds. The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&amp;rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&amp;rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?</description>

      <description>Good things come in trilogies and, in most cases, the second of the series is the best&amp;hellip;Streams of Silver is perhaps the zenith of the Icewind Dale trilogy. There are plenty of exciting adventures, desperate battles, horrifying monsters, devious sorcerers, dark dungeons, but most importantly, there is an element of the unknown. In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination.</description>

      <description>I must admit I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very impressed when I started reading the 1st book of the series. In Wizard&amp;rsquo;s First Rule, Goodkind&amp;rsquo;s writing just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to possess a certain sophistication and polish, and at times it had such a wooden quality that I found myself squirming. Now after having read through the 5th book of the series, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck around! As the tale progresses, so does the author&amp;rsquo;s mastery of his craft.</description>

      <description>The main problem with works that are inspired by or that borrow from RPG is predictability. After all, what adventure would be complete without a warrior, a rogue, and a sorcerer. Not to mention the party must include a gruff dwarf and a light-hearted, pleasure-loving halfling. The Crystal Shard has got all that and more, but it also brings to life an original in the form of Drizzt Do&amp;rsquo;Urden, who&amp;rsquo;s undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved characters in fantasy.</description>

      <description>The end of the second volume leads right into the third. As the companions escaped from Mithral Hall, Regis fell into the clutches of Artemis Entreri, the deadly assassin hired by the leader of the thieves&#39; guild in Calimport of whom Regis had run afoul. Furthermore, Entreri gained possession of the statuette that conjures the black panther Guenhwyvar, Drizzt&amp;rsquo;s faithful extra-planar companion. Saddened by the loss of Bruenor and now Regis, Drizzt and Wulfgar resolve to track down the assassin to his lair and rescue their friend, while Catti-Brie is grimly determined to finish Bruenor&amp;rsquo;s quest and retake Mithral Hall from the duergars.</description>

      <description>Pillars of Creation follows the adventures of a young woman, Jennsen, illegitimate daughter of Darken Rahl, as she travels the world in search of escape and vengeance. She is aided by a spy of the Imperial Order who may be more than he appears to be. At the same time, Jennsen&amp;rsquo;s unique ability may mean the end of all life, if she and Richard don&amp;rsquo;t discover the truth in time.</description>

      <description>Having plowed through three multi-volume fantasy series in a row, I thought this single-volume tome, the first standalone fantasy adventure by the husband-and-wife team, might be a welcome respite. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any book by the Eddingses, but their reputation as prolific and popular authors is well-known. I was further intrigued by the &amp;ldquo;#1 international bestseller&amp;rdquo; plug emblazoned on the hardcover.
The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an enthralling fantasy epic, look no further than the Sword of Truth series. Though Wizard&amp;rsquo;s First Rule isn&amp;rsquo;t the best of the series, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-read because it sets the background for the rest of the series.
Richard Cypher, a simple woods guide from the land of Hartland, has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman and soon finds himself at the center of quest to prevent a magic box of vast power from falling into the hands of Darken Rahl, a &amp;ldquo;dark&amp;rdquo; wizard of with unimaginable power and unsurpassed cruelty.</description>
