      <description>Some time ago I took a software engineering class. For the term project we divided up into teams and worked on a project of our own choosing from beginning to end. Ours was an e-commerce application, the source code for which still resides on Google Code.
We were the Fantastic Five because, you&amp;rsquo;d never guess it, there were 5 of us. I created the logo for the project. For the &amp;ldquo;super-hero&amp;rdquo; effect, it has 2 stylized F&amp;rsquo;s, made to look like wings flanking a shield.</description>
