      <description>Map of our hike on the Great Head Trail.
Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high.</description>

      <description>Map of our hike on Jesup Path.
Along with [Emery Path](http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/acadia-national-park-dorr-mountain/&amp;quot; title=&amp;ldquo;Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain), Jesup Path is another trail which can be found at the Sieur de Monts spring area. Straight and level, it&amp;rsquo;s hardly a challenging hike. Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.</description>

      <description>Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable, because it&amp;rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&amp;rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.</description>

      <title>Hiking Mount Monadnock</title>

      <description>As far as big mountain goes,[ Mount Monadnock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock&amp;quot; targtet=&amp;quot;_blank) in the southwestern corner of New Hampshire is relatively close to Boston. Despite its proximity, we&amp;rsquo;ve never set foot on it. So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&amp;rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.</description>
