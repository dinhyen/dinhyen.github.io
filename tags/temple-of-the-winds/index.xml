      <description>I must admit I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very impressed when I started reading the 1st book of the series. In Wizard&amp;rsquo;s First Rule, Goodkind&amp;rsquo;s writing just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to possess a certain sophistication and polish, and at times it had such a wooden quality that I found myself squirming. Now after having read through the 5th book of the series, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck around! As the tale progresses, so does the author&amp;rsquo;s mastery of his craft.</description>
