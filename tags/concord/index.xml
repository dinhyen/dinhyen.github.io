      <description>File this as another in the category of &amp;ldquo;places I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&amp;rdquo;. This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike. The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &amp;ldquo;the shot heard around the world&amp;rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road. On a nice day, you&amp;rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.</description>
