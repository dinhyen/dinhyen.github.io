      <description>Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads. Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior. These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle.</description>

      <description>Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&amp;rsquo;s understandable, because it&amp;rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&amp;rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.</description>
