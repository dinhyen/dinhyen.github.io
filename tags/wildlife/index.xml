      <description>Broadmoor is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary. Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&amp;rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet. Despite sounding like something out of The Hounds of the Baskervilles, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River. In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.
Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.</description>

      <description>File this as another in the category of &amp;ldquo;places I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&amp;rdquo;. This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike. The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &amp;ldquo;the shot heard around the world&amp;rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&amp;rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road. On a nice day, you&amp;rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.</description>

      <description>I lay awake at night pondering how we were going to see more critters. As it turned out, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to leave the hotel.
Tilajari Resort sits right on the bank of the San Carlos River. We woke up to the chattering sounds of birds. As we ambled to breakfast we could see the brown river glimmering just beyond a gently sloping lawn. The fruit section at breakfast was par excellence.</description>

      <description>Breakfast included blackberry and papaya juice. I love this place! We bid farewell to our avian and reptilian friends. There was some commotion on the other side of the dining hall. Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&amp;rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&amp;rsquo;s tour leader.</description>

      <description>Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&amp;rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.</description>

      <description>We went down to breakfast and ran into the Coopers. They had survived the trip from Arenal after all. However, this would be the last time that we saw them.
 Alan the entomologist at Monteverde Butterfly Garden  First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;crazy biologist guy&amp;rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.</description>

      <description>Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&amp;rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&amp;rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&amp;rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.</description>
