      <description>Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&amp;rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.</description>

      <description>We went down to breakfast and ran into the Coopers. They had survived the trip from Arenal after all. However, this would be the last time that we saw them.
First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;crazy biologist guy&amp;rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.</description>
