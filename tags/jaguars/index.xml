      <description>Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&amp;rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&amp;rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&amp;rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.</description>
