      <description>I have an HTC Aria which runs now-ancient Android 2.1. This phone is far from being the latest and greatest, to put it mildly, but I like its small form factor. After putting up with it for a year, I have had enough and decided to upgrade it to Gingerbread. This is how I did it. As this is my first attempt, no doubt there are different and better ways to do things.</description>
