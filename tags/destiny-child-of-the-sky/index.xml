      <description>2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&amp;rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&amp;rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.</description>
