      <description>I want to replace the DVR that I get from Verizon Fios. Besides the monthly cost, it&amp;rsquo;s an older unit that&amp;rsquo;s slow and has the capacity for no more than a handful 3-hour hockey games recorded in HD. That is plainly unacceptable, especially during the Stanley Cup Playoffs. For the HD tuner, I decided to go with the SiliconDust HD Homerun Prime. For the DVR, I&amp;rsquo;m going with a Mac Mini.</description>

      <description>I have an HTC Aria which runs now-ancient Android 2.1. This phone is far from being the latest and greatest, to put it mildly, but I like its small form factor. After putting up with it for a year, I have had enough and decided to upgrade it to Gingerbread. This is how I did it. As this is my first attempt, no doubt there are different and better ways to do things.</description>
