      <description>At breakfast we ran into another Belgian couple, this time from Antwerp. They were on a tour of Ontario and Québec. They were quite excited about a free outdoor performance of the Cirque de Soleil. Sophie, who made us breakfast, also told us about the Moulin de l&amp;rsquo;Images, which was some sort of projection. We&amp;rsquo;d have to check both of them out.
We escaped from warm and muggy Boston to somewhat warm and muggy Québec.</description>
