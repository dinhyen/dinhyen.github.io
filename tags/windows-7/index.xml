      <description>I wanted to upgrade a couple of PCs by replacing the motherboard (by the way, when buying PC components, if there&amp;rsquo;s a Microcenter store nearby, try it first; at the time of this writing their $50 bundle discount for a motherboard-CPU combo cannot be beat, even by much-loved online enthusiast stores). Afterwards, I found that Windows 7 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t boot.
In my prior experience, Windows would automatically detect the new motherboard and reconfigure itself accordingly.</description>

      <description>The ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 motherboard is a little long in the tooth but still quite capable. Mine has been running Windows XP Media Center Edition for some time and I decided to upgrade it to Windows 7. The challenge is that the motherboard&amp;rsquo;s JMicron SATA2 chipset isn&amp;rsquo;t detected automatically at installation. If you want to install Windows on a SATA hard drive, you will have to load the driver first. The other problem is that, as of the time of writing, there is no Windows 7 driver for the ULi integrated Ethernet controller due to the age of the hardware.</description>
