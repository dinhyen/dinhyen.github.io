Dorr Mountain is the second highest peak on Mount Desert Island, behind only Cadillac Mountain. It&rsquo;s named after George Dorr, who&rsquo;s affectionately known as the father of Acadia National Park. There are multiple paths to the summit. We chose to start from Sieur de Monts spring.
There are a couple of trails crisscrossing the area. The most obvious is Emery Path, which begins right behind the small visitors' center.

Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high.

Along with [Emery Path](http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/acadia-national-park-dorr-mountain/&quot; title=&ldquo;Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain), Jesup Path is another trail which can be found at the Sieur de Monts spring area. Straight and level, it&rsquo;s hardly a challenging hike. Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.

      The tallest peak in Acadia and the first place in the continental US to see the morning light, Cadillac Mountain is also the most accessible &ndash; you can just drive there. Nevertheless, its popularity doesn&rsquo;t detract from its appeal. Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t make it here early enough for sunrise, being worn out from hiking every day. So we had to settle for the &ldquo;other golden hour&rdquo;. Fortunately with a storm brewing in the distance all afternoon, we were treated to a beautiful sunset.

Located just a short distance from the Park Loop Road and the popular Jordan Pond, they&rsquo;re some of the most accessible climbs in the park. Both offer splendid views of Jordan Pond and, in the distance, the islands off the southern coast of Mount Desert Island.

      Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads. Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior. These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle.

Because it&rsquo;s the only national park in the northeastern US, I&rsquo;ve visited Acadia National Park several times over the years. But I&rsquo;m a bit mystified that I&rsquo;ve managed to hike it just once, and it was only last year. I think it is because I&rsquo;ve come here in a large group, for which it&rsquo;s not easy to plan a hike. Further, there are so many things to do that we&rsquo;ve always managed to find other alternatives.

I have a page with tabular data which I want to be able to sort without having to go back to the server. Also a nice-to-have would be the ability to filter the displayed items. Since I&rsquo;m trying to learn Angular, this seems like an excellent opportunity to try it out.
In the controller, the variable items holds the data to be sorted/filtered, while filteredItems is initialized to an empty array.

      Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.
Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account.

      The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city. It&rsquo;s believed that the Incas built the city of Cusco in the shape of a jaguar, with Sacsayhuamán representing the head (and the most formidable part) of the jaguar. It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.

Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

      The annual Revere Beach sculpting festival concluded over the weekend. But since it hadn&rsquo;t rained, we figured there&rsquo;s a good chance the sculptures were still around. We got there around twilight, which was even better because the absence of mid-day shadows allowed the subtle details of the sculptures to come out.

Not sure what this represents, other than a study in perspectives.

      Bringing Tolkien&rsquo;s Middle Earth to life is a monumental task. The locations, creatures and monsters have to be conceptualized, designed and created from the ground up. Capturing the spirit of Tolkien&rsquo;s work is an even more daunting challenge because of its tremendous scope, complexity and beauty. Furthermore, its legions of fans are staunch in their visions of Tolkien&rsquo;s universe, and satisfying all of them is impossible.
That the movie has been a phenomenal success and, more importantly, an incredible realization of Tolkien&rsquo;s visions is a testament to the skills and dedication of Peter Jackson and his team.

      This scenario is probably unusual but it did happen to me. I had a view named Foo.aspx and partial view named Foo.ascx. The view rendered the partial as follows:
&lt;% Html.RenderPartial(&#34;Foo&#34;); %&gt; When attempting to load the view, ASP.NET spins for a while then eventually throws a stack overflow exception. Apparently when executing the above statement, MVC searches for files named &ldquo;Foo&rdquo;, including the view itself. It must have attempted to render the view and gone into a recursive loop.

Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.

I want to convert a paged list of business objects to a paged list of view model objects with AutoMapper. In order for AutoMapper to work in this case, it needs to know how to convert a paged list. This can be done with a custom type converter:
public class PagedListConverter : ITypeConverter&lt;PagedList&lt;Person&gt;, PagedList&lt;PersonViewModel&gt;&gt; { public PagedList&lt;PersonViewModel&gt; Convert(ResolutionContext context) { var models = (PagedList&lt;Person&gt;)context.

Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.

      In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

      The Baldur&rsquo;s Gate franchise is the most popular single-player RPG series out there for good reasons, even though it&rsquo;s been a few years since its release. While more recent Black Isle games, notably Icewind Dale II, have vastly improved graphics and interface and others like Neverwinter Nights have changed the playing field entirely, BGII stands out for its tremendous scope and exceptional depth. BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading.

Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin&rsquo;s medieval universe.

      With this third hit in a row, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

      It&rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.

      2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.

      The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations.

      Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society.

The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist.

      This book is perhaps a let-down from the enthralling Temple of the Winds.

The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story.

In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination.

Furthermore, its legions of fans are staunch in their visions of Tolkien&rsquo;s universe, and satisfying all of them is impossible.
That the movie has been a phenomenal success and, more importantly, an incredible realization of Tolkien&rsquo;s visions is a testament to the skills and dedication of Peter Jackson and his team.

In the darkened arena, packed to the rafters with almost 18000 screaming fans, the lone spotlight descended on an area in the stands. Momentarily, a middle-aged man clad in a vintage Bruins jersey stepped into the light. The crowd erupted. It was none other than the legendary Bobby Orr, the man universally regarded as the finest defenseman in the history of hockey.

      Defensemen #33 Zdeno Chara - Tallest man in hockey history and probably using the longest stick and wearing the largest skates as well. With his monstrous wingspan he can easily cover his half of the ice. Very nice guy off the ice, but a big (and tall) bogeyman on it.
#44 Dennis Seidenberg - Rugged German-born defenseman. Blocks a ton of shot. Possesses outstanding balance and is very strong on his skates.

      Boston&rsquo;s first Stanley Cup parade in 39 years was going to take place on Saturday, June 18, three days after the team celebrated on the ice in Vancouver. It was as definitive a &ldquo;clear your calendar&rdquo;-type event as it will ever be. On the morning of C-day, we got up early, loaded up with a hearty breakfast, filled the caffeine meter, and made sure we went to the bathroom before heading down to the T.

      Zdeno Chara grabbed hold of the Cup, reverently brought it to his lips, then raised it above his head, repeating a ritual performed by all previous Cup-winning captains. The only difference was that it had not been done by someone wearing the spoked-B since Nixon was President. The events of this night surely sent Bruins fans everywhere into a delirium. For the entire time that the Bruins celebrated on the ice, I had a stupidly wide grin on my face.

Despite knowing so little about the game, I was hooked immediately when I came to Boston in the mid-90s.

      Last morning in Québec. We took a 5-minute walk to check out the cool murals we saw earlier. These are quite amazing. A Gothic church exterior. An ornate stained-glass interior with a mysterious figure hooded in black. A ancient Aztec-meet-Egyptian structure surrounded by jungle. The best one yet was a castle with a red dragon, unfortunately obscured by the scaffolding for the Cirque de Soleil. I think you&rsquo;d agree that these undoubtedly are the coolest highway underpasses anywhere.

      Broadmoor is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary. Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet. Despite sounding like something out of The Hounds of the Baskervilles, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River. In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.
Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.

Yet I&rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner. The Habitat sanctuary is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.

      With laser printer, scanner, Ethernet and Wifi interface rolled into one, the Brother HL-2280DW is quite a little champ. However, for me, getting the Wifi to work was a bit of a challenge. The installer would die silently after configuring Wifi but without having installed the software. After some trial and error, I was able to successfully install for Ethernet . With the software installed, I was able to configure Wifi afterward.

Since products can be added or removed from an order, we need to manage the order details for each Order.

In one case, I find that the AutoMapper doesn&rsquo;t work for all properties. One property in particular doesn&rsquo;t get mapped. If I manually assign a value to it as a test, I would get a ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException.

The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use.

        Canon PowerShot S30 3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Canon&rsquo;s S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots. Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous. The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use.

      Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads. Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior. These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle.

      I was attracted to Rhapsody, the first book of the Rhapsody trilogy, by way of its critical acclaim as one of the best fantasy debut in years. The book does not disappoint. It&rsquo;s a marvellously executed masterpiece of high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien that we all know and love. The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist.

First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy biologist guy&rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.

 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

      Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.

      It&rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.

      I ran into an subtle bug today. Let&rsquo;s say we have a shopping cart page that displays order details and allows the user to remove items from the order. We retrieve the items in the order with the following:
var items = DataContext.Orders.Single(o =&gt; o.Id == orderId).Items; To remove an item from the order, we have the following:
var itemToDelete = DataContext.Items.Single(i =&gt; i.Id == itemId); DataContext.Items.DeleteOnSubmit(itemToDelete); DataContext.SubmitChanges(); It&rsquo;s run-of-the-mill as far as LINQ to SQL goes.

It seems like I&rsquo;m always working on search boxes, but here goes another. My goal here is to display an icon inside the search box. Initially, the search box has a dark background. When clicked, the background changes to white. The icon should changes its color based on whether or not the search box has focus. If we were using a font-based icon such as Fontawesome, which is awesome by the way, styling the icon would be a simple exercise.

      Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&rsquo;s understandable, because it&rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.

After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.

The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use.

In retrospect, the drawbacks of two-dimensional graphics and comical looking monsters didn&rsquo;t detract much from the overall experience. Doom might not have invented the first-person shooter, but it made it a bona fide genre.

      When drawing portrait with a pencil, I find it challenging to get realistic-looking hair. You may not want to draw individual strands of hair. If you&rsquo;re not careful, the person may end up looking like Gollum. I follow an approach of first putting down a base layer by using a soft pencil to fill out the shape of the hair and blending stumps to create a uniform appearance. The blending stumps are used to effect a smooth, gradual transition between light and dark which is more realistic.

The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary.

      In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.

Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary.

      If you&rsquo;re looking for an enthralling fantasy epic, look no further than the Sword of Truth series. Though Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule isn&rsquo;t the best of the series, it&rsquo;s a must-read because it sets the background for the rest of the series.
Richard Cypher, a simple woods guide from the land of Hartland, has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman and soon finds himself at the center of quest to prevent a magic box of vast power from falling into the hands of Darken Rahl, a &ldquo;dark&rdquo; wizard of with unimaginable power and unsurpassed cruelty.

I had known about hockey quite early on since Las Vegas had a minor-league team, the now-defunct Las Vegas Thunder, and a friend was a big fan. Despite knowing so little about the game, I was hooked immediately when I came to Boston in the mid-90s.

      Winter dragged its feel longer than usual this year. The first day of spring came and went, yet the dreariness continued well into April.

The Cascade (map): Trail head begins at the end of a very suburban road. Very limited street parking (think 2-3 spaces, depending on the skills of the driver). A short hike takes you over a nice wooden bridge as well as a fallen log-bridge. The waterfalls drops into a shallow pool at the trail.
Mount Greylock summit (map): The foliage on Mount Greylock was past-peak when we were there.

Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.

      In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading.

I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I have an HTC Aria which runs now-ancient Android 2.1. This phone is far from being the latest and greatest, to put it mildly, but I like its small form factor. After putting up with it for a year, I have had enough and decided to upgrade it to Gingerbread. This is how I did it. As this is my first attempt, no doubt there are different and better ways to do things.

      At home I use a MacBook to connect via VPN to the office. I&rsquo;d have access to the intranet but not shell access to my workstation. Since I usually work on the same project at home and at the office, I need to keep my work synchronized. One way to do that is with a Git remote branch.
At the office, I&rsquo;d create a local branch for the story I&rsquo;d like to work on:

      When we traveled by car in Spain and Portugal in 2007, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that we managed to get around several cities using only a Michelin road atlas and a bunch of printouts of online maps. This time we&rsquo;re fully embracing 21st-century technology and bringing along a GPS device. To help save time, I like to enter destinations or waypoints ahead of time. On my Garmin nüvi 255W, it&rsquo;s a time-consuming process to enter waypoints (which Garmin calls Favorites).

      The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &ldquo;How did they do it?&rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy.

In 2010, the Regatta took place on a chilly weekend in late October (this was Boston, after all). For me, there was nothing better than to put on a warm jacket, hop on the bike for the half-hour ride to Harvard University, then snap away.

The best one yet was a castle with a red dragon, unfortunately obscured by the scaffolding for the Cirque de Soleil. I think you&rsquo;d agree that these undoubtedly are the coolest highway underpasses anywhere.

Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.

I think it is because I&rsquo;ve come here in a large group, for which it&rsquo;s not easy to plan a hike. Further, there are so many things to do that we&rsquo;ve always managed to find other alternatives.

So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.

We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

 At the 2011 NHL All-Stars game, NY Islanders forward Michael Grabner won the Fastest Skater competition with a time of 14.238 seconds. The track length is about 550 ft. This translates to 38.6 ft or 12.9 yards/second. For comparison, let&rsquo;s look at the fastest 40-yard dash for football players, who are speedsters in their own right.

      Every September since 2005, the city of Boston has held a charity bike ride to benefit of one of its educational programs. The event is called Hub on Wheels, a clever pun based on Boston&rsquo;s modest nickname for itself, the Hub of the Universe. For the majority of riders, it would be the only time of the year that they get an intimate view of some of Boston&rsquo;s lesser-known neighborhoods. There are 3 available courses, 10-, 30- and 50-mile.

      We use Hudson as our continuous integration server (although we&rsquo;re thinking about moving to Jenkins, but that&rsquo;s a different story). This post describes how we set up Hudson to work with Git and MSBuild on a Windows server.
Pre-requisites We use the following software. The listed versions are the latest as of the time of writing, but other combinations should work.
 Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7 Apache Tomcat 7.0 Hudson 2.

      We use Hudson to deploy our web application to different environments such as QA, demo and production. We need to customize the web.config, primarily the database connection string, for each environment . Previously we had to maintain multiple copies of the web.config and copy the appropriate one for each deployment destination. Obviously keeping around different versions of the same file is far from ideal.
As an improvement, we decide to keep a single web.

      Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.
Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account.

However, we had heard really good things about Ollantaytambo. As it turned out, when we returned from Machu Picchu the night before, Lima Tours sent a driver to pick us up at Ollantaytambo.

      The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city.

It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.

Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

      I&rsquo;ve been discovering more and more of the amazing gems that are the Audubon sanctuaries. Recently I visited the Ipswich River sanctuary and the Broadmoor sanctuary, both of which are amazing for the scenery and wildlife they contain. Yet I&rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner. The Habitat sanctuary is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.

      Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.

We&rsquo;re gradually gravitating toward AngularJS because it&rsquo;s more powerful and flexible. However with AngularJS we have some issues with IE7, which unfortunately we&rsquo;re stuck supporting. So when I want to add some simple enhancements to the search box, I went back to KnockoutJS. For a simple scenario such as this, KnockoutJS works great. If we had to do this using plain jQuery, we&rsquo;d have to juggle keypress, focus and blur events which is just unnecessary drudgery!

      The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &ldquo;How did they do it?&rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy.

      When drawing portrait with a pencil, I find it challenging to get realistic-looking hair. You may not want to draw individual strands of hair. If you&rsquo;re not careful, the person may end up looking like Gollum. I follow an approach of first putting down a base layer by using a soft pencil to fill out the shape of the hair and blending stumps to create a uniform appearance. The blending stumps are used to effect a smooth, gradual transition between light and dark which is more realistic.

KnockoutJS is a dynamic UI framework that can really liberate you from the tedium of low-level DOM manipulations. Even though I&rsquo;ve only played with it for a little while, I&rsquo;ve become a huge fan. One of my initial attempts is to create an animated text input similar to Twitter&rsquo;s.
The UI is quite simple. The textbox should display a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; prompt. When the user clicks inside the textbox, expand it and display a save button, initially disabled.

      I ran into an subtle bug today. Let&rsquo;s say we have a shopping cart page that displays order details and allows the user to remove items from the order. We retrieve the items in the order with the following:
var items = DataContext.Orders.Single(o =&gt; o.Id == orderId).Items; To remove an item from the order, we have the following:
var itemToDelete = DataContext.Items.Single(i =&gt; i.Id == itemId); DataContext.Items.DeleteOnSubmit(itemToDelete); DataContext.SubmitChanges(); It&rsquo;s run-of-the-mill as far as LINQ to SQL goes.

      We&rsquo;re using AutoMapper in ASP.NET MVC automate the mapping of properties between entity and view model objects. This is a highly useful tool which helps us avoid the tedium of having to assigning properties manually. Here&rsquo;s a good introduction to using AutoMapper.
In one case, I find that the AutoMapper doesn&rsquo;t work for all properties. One property in particular doesn&rsquo;t get mapped. If I manually assign a value to it as a test, I would get a ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException.

      Some time ago I took a software engineering class. For the term project we divided up into teams and worked on a project of our own choosing from beginning to end. Ours was an e-commerce application, the source code for which still resides on Google Code.
We were the Fantastic Five because, you&rsquo;d never guess it, there were 5 of us. I created the logo for the project. For the &ldquo;super-hero&rdquo; effect, it has 2 stylized F&rsquo;s, made to look like wings flanking a shield.

      Bringing Tolkien&rsquo;s Middle Earth to life is a monumental task. The locations, creatures and monsters have to be conceptualized, designed and created from the ground up. Capturing the spirit of Tolkien&rsquo;s work is an even more daunting challenge because of its tremendous scope, complexity and beauty. Furthermore, its legions of fans are staunch in their visions of Tolkien&rsquo;s universe, and satisfying all of them is impossible.
That the movie has been a phenomenal success and, more importantly, an incredible realization of Tolkien&rsquo;s visions is a testament to the skills and dedication of Peter Jackson and his team.

      Breakfast included blackberry and papaya juice. I love this place! We bid farewell to our avian and reptilian friends. There was some commotion on the other side of the dining hall. Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&rsquo;s tour leader.

      The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat.

      The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters.

      As far as big mountain goes,[ Mount Monadnock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock&quot; targtet=&quot;_blank) in the southwestern corner of New Hampshire is relatively close to Boston. Despite its proximity, we&rsquo;ve never set foot on it. So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.

      Some time ago I saw a poster of doors. No, not these doors. I decided that I wanted one for myself. I picked Beacon Hill, a historic neighborhood known for its elegant houses and stately mansions. I biked around at dusk purposely so that the lights would be on, stopped frequently and snapped away. Some people, predictably, were wary of a stranger taking pictures of their homes. However, once I explained what I was doing, they were quite understanding.

First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy biologist guy&rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.

Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.

      Looper, starring Bruce Willis and that awkward kid in Third Rock from the Sun, is a terrific movie with extraordinary storytelling, tightly woven narrative and great acting. I really enjoy it very much, despite some misgivings about its remorseless violence and relentlessly depressing depiction of the future. However, since I&rsquo;ve been asked if I can poke any hole in it, I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself as a task to find a chink or two in the movie&rsquo;s formidable armor, much in the same spirit as this critique.

      We use Hudson to deploy our web application to different environments such as QA, demo and production.

Previously we had to maintain multiple copies of the web.config and copy the appropriate one for each deployment destination. Obviously keeping around different versions of the same file is far from ideal.
As an improvement, we decide to keep a single web.

Then the build process started to fail with error MSB3202, &ldquo;the project file was not found&rdquo;.

      Since 1999 I&rsquo;ve helped run a pickup hockey group at the Skating Club of Boston. We&rsquo;re really not crazy about the rink there. The ice is intended for figure skaters so it&rsquo;s soft and thus slow and quick to become choppy. There is no glass above the boards so if you shoot high enough you&rsquo;d have to go fish for the puck under the stands. And since figure skaters generally stay in the middle of the ice, the edges are neglected and not well maintained; this is a problem if you try to &ldquo;wrap the puck around the board&rdquo;.

      In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.

      At breakfast we ran into another Belgian couple, this time from Antwerp. They were on a tour of Ontario and Québec. They were quite excited about a free outdoor performance of the Cirque de Soleil. Sophie, who made us breakfast, also told us about the Moulin de l&rsquo;Images, which was some sort of projection. We&rsquo;d have to check both of them out.
We escaped from warm and muggy Boston to somewhat warm and muggy Québec.

      With this third hit in a row, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

      It&rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.

      2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.

      The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

      The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next.

Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters.

      Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society.

The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist.

In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.
Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account.

      On our last day in Peru, our flight from Cusco wouldn&rsquo;t be until 15h30. Until then we could either wander around Cusco or use our Boleto Turístico to explore the other ruins on the outskirts of Cusco (Puca Pucara, Q&rsquo;enqo and Tambomachay). However, we had heard really good things about Ollantaytambo. As it turned out, when we returned from Machu Picchu the night before, Lima Tours sent a driver to pick us up at Ollantaytambo.

      The largest Inca complex in Cusco is Sacsayhuamán, a walled fortress which stands on a hill overlooking the city. It&rsquo;s believed that the Incas built the city of Cusco in the shape of a jaguar, with Sacsayhuamán representing the head (and the most formidable part) of the jaguar. It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.

Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy.

I follow an approach of first putting down a base layer by using a soft pencil to fill out the shape of the hair and blending stumps to create a uniform appearance. The blending stumps are used to effect a smooth, gradual transition between light and dark which is more realistic.

There are plenty of exciting adventures, desperate battles, horrifying monsters, devious sorcerers, dark dungeons, but most importantly, there is an element of the unknown. In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination.

      The main problem with works that are inspired by or that borrow from RPG is predictability. After all, what adventure would be complete without a warrior, a rogue, and a sorcerer. Not to mention the party must include a gruff dwarf and a light-hearted, pleasure-loving halfling. The Crystal Shard has got all that and more, but it also brings to life an original in the form of Drizzt Do&rsquo;Urden, who&rsquo;s undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved characters in fantasy.

      The end of the second volume leads right into the third. As the companions escaped from Mithral Hall, Regis fell into the clutches of Artemis Entreri, the deadly assassin hired by the leader of the thieves' guild in Calimport of whom Regis had run afoul. Furthermore, Entreri gained possession of the statuette that conjures the black panther Guenhwyvar, Drizzt&rsquo;s faithful extra-planar companion. Saddened by the loss of Bruenor and now Regis, Drizzt and Wulfgar resolve to track down the assassin to his lair and rescue their friend, while Catti-Brie is grimly determined to finish Bruenor&rsquo;s quest and retake Mithral Hall from the duergars.

      Having plowed through three multi-volume fantasy series in a row, I thought this single-volume tome, the first standalone fantasy adventure by the husband-and-wife team, might be a welcome respite. I haven&rsquo;t read any book by the Eddingses, but their reputation as prolific and popular authors is well-known. I was further intrigued by the &ldquo;#1 international bestseller&rdquo; plug emblazoned on the hardcover.
The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary.

While more recent Black Isle games, notably Icewind Dale II, have vastly improved graphics and interface and others like Neverwinter Nights have changed the playing field entirely, BGII stands out for its tremendous scope and exceptional depth. BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading.

It may be hard to see it now, as the city has undergone dramatic changes in the intervening centuries. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the jagged outline of the walls bears remarkable resemblance to rows of teeth.

Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more.

Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

      Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.

      Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.

      Having plowed through three multi-volume fantasy series in a row, I thought this single-volume tome, the first standalone fantasy adventure by the husband-and-wife team, might be a welcome respite. I haven&rsquo;t read any book by the Eddingses, but their reputation as prolific and popular authors is well-known. I was further intrigued by the &ldquo;#1 international bestseller&rdquo; plug emblazoned on the hardcover.

The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?

I really enjoy it very much, despite some misgivings about its remorseless violence and relentlessly depressing depiction of the future. However, since I&rsquo;ve been asked if I can poke any hole in it, I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself as a task to find a chink or two in the movie&rsquo;s formidable armor, much in the same spirit as this critique.

      The SQL Server Designer is a nice visual tool for making modifications to a table. However, when you save the changes, SQL Server actually drops the entire table and then recreates it (if there are data in the table, they would be retained). This happens even if the changes made do not actually require that the table be re-created. This is presumably so that SQL Server can accommodate all possible types of modification.

I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

      The tallest peak in Acadia and the first place in the continental US to see the morning light, Cadillac Mountain is also the most accessible &ndash; you can just drive there. Nevertheless, its popularity doesn&rsquo;t detract from its appeal. Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t make it here early enough for sunrise, being worn out from hiking every day. So we had to settle for the &ldquo;other golden hour&rdquo;. Fortunately with a storm brewing in the distance all afternoon, we were treated to a beautiful sunset.

Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&rsquo;s tour leader.

      I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago. This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.
After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

In the darkened arena, packed to the rafters with almost 18000 screaming fans, the lone spotlight descended on an area in the stands. Momentarily, a middle-aged man clad in a vintage Bruins jersey stepped into the light. The crowd erupted. It was none other than the legendary Bobby Orr, the man universally regarded as the finest defenseman in the history of hockey.

      Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society.

      This book is perhaps a let-down from the enthralling Temple of the Winds. The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?

      The SQL Server Designer is a nice visual tool for making modifications to a table. However, when you save the changes, SQL Server actually drops the entire table and then recreates it (if there are data in the table, they would be retained). This happens even if the changes made do not actually require that the table be re-created. This is presumably so that SQL Server can accommodate all possible types of modification.

      The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat.

      The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters.

Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high.

      Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back. It&rsquo;s understandable, because it&rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge. If I&rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc). However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.

So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.

      I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago. This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.
After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I wanted to upgrade a couple of PCs by replacing the motherboard (by the way, when buying PC components, if there&rsquo;s a Microcenter store nearby, try it first; at the time of this writing their $50 bundle discount for a motherboard-CPU combo cannot be beat, even by much-loved online enthusiast stores). Afterwards, I found that Windows 7 wouldn&rsquo;t boot.
In my prior experience, Windows would automatically detect the new motherboard and reconfigure itself accordingly.

      The ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 motherboard is a little long in the tooth but still quite capable. Mine has been running Windows XP Media Center Edition for some time and I decided to upgrade it to Windows 7. The challenge is that the motherboard&rsquo;s JMicron SATA2 chipset isn&rsquo;t detected automatically at installation. If you want to install Windows on a SATA hard drive, you will have to load the driver first. The other problem is that, as of the time of writing, there is no Windows 7 driver for the ULi integrated Ethernet controller due to the age of the hardware.

      In my Visual Studio project, I want to run an external executable, SQLMetal, in a build event. The only problem is that the location of the executable depends on whether the machine runs x64 or 32-bit Windows. It is found in the Program Files (x86) folder on x64 Windows and Program Files on 32-bit Windows. I want to be able to build the project without modification in either environment.
The solution is to specify the location of the Program Files dynamically by inserting the following lines in the .

      I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a Wix installer to work. This particular scenario is pretty simple. I want to configure the database via a custom action, then start a Windows service which then queries the database before starting. This would seem like a commonplace scenario. However, Wix documentations are sparse and I&rsquo;ve been wrangling with this for some time. I finally found a solution. While I loathe to reference a StackOverflow answer, as a favor to my future self I&rsquo;m going to do so anyways.

      Batch files are the last resort due to its Neanderthal abilities and exasperating syntax. But if I want to run a bunch of things on bare-boned Windows Server 2003, this seems like the quickest if not only option.
I tried something like this, by creating a property for the system executable cmd.exe, which would execute the batch script via the /c switch. Then I created a custom action that relies on the property.

      I don&rsquo;t think anyone would argue that regularly backing up data is a good idea. At the same time, most people including myself don&rsquo;t do so nearly often enough. Fortunately, the VDeck control panel provided by my web host helps make backing up and restoring data a cinch.
To back up my Wordpress blog, I need to back up both the files and the MySQL database. To back up files, use the Archive Gateway.

      In my former Wordpress blog, I used the excellent NextGen plugin to manage images in galleries.

Inline images, however, are still directly linked and not shown as an overlay. When viewed, it requires an additional click or two to go back to the post.
