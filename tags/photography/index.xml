      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m fond of landscape photography. However when there&amp;rsquo;s a human subject, applying the same kind of composition can come out looking too formal or posed. I&amp;rsquo;d like to achieve more of the natural, spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment feel. For that I want to have a lens that&amp;rsquo;s fast, focuses quickly and has good bokeh. A prime lens would have those qualities at a much lower price point than a telephoto lens. With that settled, I had to decide between 35, 50 and 85mm.</description>

      <description>The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &amp;ldquo;How did they do it?&amp;rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy.</description>
