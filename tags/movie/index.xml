      <description>Looper, starring Bruce Willis and that awkward kid in Third Rock from the Sun, is a terrific movie with extraordinary storytelling, tightly woven narrative and great acting. I really enjoy it very much, despite some misgivings about its remorseless violence and relentlessly depressing depiction of the future. However, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked if I can poke any hole in it, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken it upon myself as a task to find a chink or two in the movie&amp;rsquo;s formidable armor, much in the same spirit as this critique.</description>
