      <description>In my former Wordpress blog, I used the excellent NextGen pluginÂ to manage images in galleries. When embedded in a post, the gallery is rendered as thumbnails, whose full-size version is shown as an overlay when clicked. I also like to embed inline images so that I can include a caption. Inline images, however, are still directly linked and not shown as an overlay. When viewed, it requires an additional click or two to go back to the post.</description>
