      <description>We decided to take off around 16:00 on Friday. In addition to the rush hour, we anticipated no fewer than 100000 Bostonians to be on the move for the long weekend. So we avoided the main highways altogether. Our plans worked, and when we re-connected with Interstate-93 North it was in Manchester, NH, some 60 miles away. The drive through the magnificent White Mountains was quite pleasant, as usual. Nevertheless, it was to be a very long drive.</description>

      <description>In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts. The former was a bit more adventurous. We went on a hike on North Moat Mountain and underestimated the terrain (or overestimated our ability). Even though we&amp;rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.</description>
