      <description>The benefits of a wired home network are many. I use the SiliconDust HDHomerun Prime network TV tuners to watch cable TV on any computer in the house without the need for a set-top box.

The picture would be plagued with stutters, pause and artifacts and pretty much unwatchable, especially for hockey with its lightning-fast actions.</description>
