We were an early adopter of the Chevrolet Bolt BEV, having owned one since its introductory year of 2017. In 2020 after our second car died, we went out and got another one. Having BEVs as all of our vehicles necesitates having a level 2 charger at home.

      Octopress instructions are for setting up a new repo; i.e. by running rake setup_github_pages. It doesn’t work if you’ve cloned an existing repo.
You have to manually set up a git repository in the _deploy directory which should track the master branch of the repo on GitHub.
# create new deploy dir rm -rf _deploy mkdir _deploy cd _deploy # initialize empty git repo git init git remote add origin git@github.

I feel compelled to write this post so that Kate wouldn&rsquo;t think I spent all that time in the garage playing video games (I wish I could). I was deciding between the Curt and a DrawTite trailer hitch. The Curt seemed more substantial, is made in Wisconsin (the DrawTite is made in Mexico) and as it turned out is surprisingly lighter (lighter being relative, more on that later).

      I have a first-generation Nexus 7 tablet made by Asus which ran KitKat 4.4. When the OTA Lollipop update became available, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to install it. The latest and greatest Android running on Google hardware seemed to be a match made in heaven; it would be better, prettier and faster, right? As you can probably guess from the title of this post, the answer was a resounding no. Everything became sluggish, swipes would only registered after a couple of seconds, random things popped open and close.

        Validating multiple fields with Angular
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Angular makes it simple to validate a single form field. Validating multiple fields requires a bit more work. The approach that works for me is use a directive to lay out the framework, but to perform the actual validation in the parent scope. Since the user defines the specifics of the validation, any arbitrary validation can be performed and the directive can be kept simple.
In this example, I&rsquo;d like to validate that the sum of 2 text inputs equals 10.

      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Two things can happen when the user fills out a form field: the entered value is incorrect or the value is missing. With Angular validating either case is consistent and simple. The issue is when to show the error message: as the value is being entered, after the field loses focus or after the user submits the form. I think that for a better usability, the user should be informed that the value is incorrect while entering the value.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Have a problem with Angular scope variable binding not working on a Jekyll or Octopress (which uses Jekyll) page? It so happens that Jekyll&rsquo;s Liquid Template uses the same {{ foo }} syntax as Angular and would attempt to process the markup before Angular can get to it. To get around the problem, you can surround Angular markup with {% raw %}and {% endraw %}tags. Alternatively, you can also forgo from using this syntax altogether and use Angular&rsquo;s ng-bind directive to bind a variable to a DOM element.

        Copying files in Hudson

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Copying files somewhere is pretty standard procedure when deploying an app. Interestingly I&rsquo;ve never had to copy files directly in Hudson. Until now I&rsquo;ve only deployed .NET apps in Hudson and used MSBuild&rsquo;s Copy task to copy the files to a share folder. Now that I want to deploy Angular and other client apps in Hudson, I&rsquo;d have to copy the files manually.
My initial attempt was to add a new Execute Shell build step to run xcopy.

      The benefits of a wired home network are many. I use the SiliconDust HDHomerun Prime network TV tuners to watch cable TV on any computer in the house without the need for a set-top box. However, it is quite bandwidth-intensive and even a wireless-N connection just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. The picture would be plagued with stutters, pause and artifacts and pretty much unwatchable, especially for hockey with its lightning-fast actions.

      Developers are lazy by nature and always look for ways to avoid having to perform repetitive tasks. There are plenty of options when you&rsquo;re working with conventional server-side platforms. Unfortunately, when it comes to JavaScripts and CSS, automation tools are harder to find. That is, until Grunt comes along (following Node, which turned upside down the whole idea of server vs client side in the first place).
As a self-described &ldquo;task runner&rdquo;, Grunt is powerful and pleasantly approachable.
