      2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The original Doom introduced a whole new world to video games. It had a vast, immersive, incredibly realistic environment which gave the player an experience closer to reality than anything else had been able to achieve (having non-orthogonal walls helped). In retrospect, the drawbacks of two-dimensional graphics and comical looking monsters didn&rsquo;t detract much from the overall experience. Doom might not have invented the first-person shooter, but it made it a bona fide genre.

      The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.

      After the setback at the end of book two, hope finally dawns on Krynn. For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat.

      The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society.

      In a world populated with excellent RPG games, IWD2 stands out for its solid foundation of compelling story line, great game play, and high replayability. It&rsquo;s hard to please all RPG fans who desire different mixes of action, quest, and character development. IWD2 strikes a nice balance between quest-laden Baldur&rsquo;s Gate and Diablo&rsquo;s mindless click-fest. There are plenty of hack and slash to be found here, including all-out melees with a multitude of foes and harrowing battles against powerful monsters.

      The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &ldquo;How did they do it?&rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy.

      I was attracted to Rhapsody, the first book of the Rhapsody trilogy, by way of its critical acclaim as one of the best fantasy debut in years. The book does not disappoint. It&rsquo;s a marvellously executed masterpiece of high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien that we all know and love. The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist.

      This book is perhaps a let-down from the enthralling Temple of the Winds. The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?
