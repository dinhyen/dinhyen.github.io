I have a page with tabular data which I want to be able to sort without having to go back to the server. Also a nice-to-have would be the ability to filter the displayed items. Since I&rsquo;m trying to learn Angular, this seems like an excellent opportunity to try it out.
In the controller, the variable items holds the data to be sorted/filtered, while filteredItems is initialized to an empty array.

      I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a Wix installer to work. This particular scenario is pretty simple. I want to configure the database via a custom action, then start a Windows service which then queries the database before starting. This would seem like a commonplace scenario. However, Wix documentations are sparse and I&rsquo;ve been wrangling with this for some time. I finally found a solution. While I loathe to reference a StackOverflow answer, as a favor to my future self I&rsquo;m going to do so anyways.

      Batch files are the last resort due to its Neanderthal abilities and exasperating syntax. But if I want to run a bunch of things on bare-boned Windows Server 2003, this seems like the quickest if not only option.
I tried something like this, by creating a property for the system executable cmd.exe, which would execute the batch script via the /c switch. Then I created a custom action that relies on the property.

      Having moved to the &lsquo;burbs recently, I look forward to attending the Bruins&rsquo; regular-season practice sessions at Ristuccia Arena in Wilmington, now that it&rsquo;s only a few miles away. The 2013 Training Camp, though, was held at TD Garden the weekend of September 14-15. Of course I was going to be there.
The 2013 season was a bit of a roller coaster ride. It was thrilling at times, but ultimately disappointing.

It seems like I&rsquo;m always working on search boxes, but here goes another. My goal here is to display an icon inside the search box. Initially, the search box has a dark background. When clicked, the background changes to white. The icon should changes its color based on whether or not the search box has focus. If we were using a font-based icon such as Fontawesome, which is awesome by the way, styling the icon would be a simple exercise.

We&rsquo;re gradually gravitating toward AngularJS because it&rsquo;s more powerful and flexible. However with AngularJS we have some issues with IE7, which unfortunately we&rsquo;re stuck supporting. So when I want to add some simple enhancements to the search box, I went back to KnockoutJS. For a simple scenario such as this, KnockoutJS works great. If we had to do this using plain jQuery, we&rsquo;d have to juggle keypress, focus and blur events which is just unnecessary drudgery!

KnockoutJS is a dynamic UI framework that can really liberate you from the tedium of low-level DOM manipulations. Even though I&rsquo;ve only played with it for a little while, I&rsquo;ve become a huge fan. One of my initial attempts is to create an animated text input similar to Twitter&rsquo;s.
The UI is quite simple. The textbox should display a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; prompt. When the user clicks inside the textbox, expand it and display a save button, initially disabled.

      I recently upgraded the hard drive on my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard to a 120GB OCZ Vertex 3 SSD. As advertised, the boot up and application start times are dramatically reduced. The SSD is everything I had hoped for. Well, almost. There has been a persistent and quite annoying issue. At random intervals, the computer would be come unresponsive. I could move the mouse or type on the keyboard, but nothing woud happen.

      Since 1999 I&rsquo;ve helped run a pickup hockey group at the Skating Club of Boston. We&rsquo;re really not crazy about the rink there. The ice is intended for figure skaters so it&rsquo;s soft and thus slow and quick to become choppy. There is no glass above the boards so if you shoot high enough you&rsquo;d have to go fish for the puck under the stands. And since figure skaters generally stay in the middle of the ice, the edges are neglected and not well maintained; this is a problem if you try to &ldquo;wrap the puck around the board&rdquo;.

The equipment in question is an American Standard (Trane) Freedom 90 gas furnace that&rsquo;s about 7 years old. Recently, in fact right in the middle of a record-setting snowstorm, it started blowing only cold air.
