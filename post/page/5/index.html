Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more. Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas. Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins. Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.

      We arrived at airport with just 1 hour to spare. I am quite impressed with LAN Chile Airline. Plenty of professional bilingual staff are available to assist passengers at automated check-in kiosks. Oh and they&rsquo;re all attractive young women. In other parts of the world some old traditions still persist. Our flight to Cusco was short, about 1h. Our Peruvian fellow passenger was nice enough to stick the my GPS receiver behind the window shade so that we get a GPS trace of the flight path.

      Our Peru adventure didn&rsquo;t start out well. Our flight from Boston was delayed for 90 min and managed to land in Newark 5 minutes after the connection had already left. We were rerouted to Miami and put on a flight to Lima that arrived at 4:30 in the morning. The streets were mostly devoid of traffic though surprisingly some street sweepers were out working. Leaving the airport we scurried through a warren of narrow streets not unlike San Jose, Costa Rica, but soon things opened up when we got on the highway that runs along the ocean.

      The annual Revere Beach sculpting festival concluded over the weekend. But since it hadn&rsquo;t rained, we figured there&rsquo;s a good chance the sculptures were still around. We got there around twilight, which was even better because the absence of mid-day shadows allowed the subtle details of the sculptures to come out.

Not sure what this represents, other than a study in perspectives.

      Map of our round-trip hike to Dorr Mountain from Sieur de Monts.
Dorr Mountain is the second highest peak on Mount Desert Island, behind only Cadillac Mountain. It&rsquo;s named after George Dorr, who&rsquo;s affectionately known as the father of Acadia National Park. There are multiple paths to the summit. We chose to start from Sieur de Monts spring.
There are a couple of trails crisscrossing the area. The most obvious is Emery Path, which begins right behind the small visitors' center.

      Map of our hike on the Great Head Trail.
Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high.

Along with [Emery Path](http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/acadia-national-park-dorr-mountain/&quot; title=&ldquo;Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain), Jesup Path is another trail which can be found at the Sieur de Monts spring area. Straight and level, it&rsquo;s hardly a challenging hike. Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.

      Sometimes I&rsquo;d like to only allow a property to be set in the constructor. Something like this:
private Foo _foo; public Foo Foo { get { return _foo; } } public Bar(Foo foo) { _foo = foo; } This neat little pattern lets you do the same with fewer members (and lines of code):
public Foo { get; private set; } public Bar(Foo foo) { Foo = foo; }

      The tallest peak in Acadia and the first place in the continental US to see the morning light, Cadillac Mountain is also the most accessible &ndash; you can just drive there. Nevertheless, its popularity doesn&rsquo;t detract from its appeal. Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t make it here early enough for sunrise, being worn out from hiking every day. So we had to settle for the &ldquo;other golden hour&rdquo;. Fortunately with a storm brewing in the distance all afternoon, we were treated to a beautiful sunset.

When seen from a distance, it&rsquo;s immediately obvious why the Bubbles are so named, though I&rsquo;m sure you can think of more colorful analogies. Located just a short distance from the Park Loop Road and the popular Jordan Pond, they&rsquo;re some of the most accessible climbs in the park. Both offer splendid views of Jordan Pond and, in the distance, the islands off the southern coast of Mount Desert Island.
