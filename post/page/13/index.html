      Breakfast included blackberry and papaya juice. I love this place! We bid farewell to our avian and reptilian friends. There was some commotion on the other side of the dining hall. Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&rsquo;s tour leader.

      Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved. This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook. As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English. The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.

      We went down to breakfast and ran into the Coopers. They had survived the trip from Arenal after all. However, this would be the last time that we saw them.
First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas. Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy biologist guy&rdquo; mold. Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums.

      The flight was to be at 13:00 so we planned on departing no later than 10:30. That left us about 1h after breakfast to explore downtown San Jose. We were 4 blocks away from the Jade Museum, which owns the largest collection of Pre-Columbian jade artifacts anywhere. Unfortunately a museum was out of the question given the time constraint.
There are quite a few pleasant green spaces which serve to provide respite in the brick and concrete jungle.

      I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago. This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.
After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time. Checklist:
 guide book (2008 edition), Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someoneÂ the Costa Rica edition), camera + telephoto lens + tripod for waterfalls shots, Bose noise-canceling headphone, book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon), pair of binoculars, bug repellent, waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).

      Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s. You must think we love it. In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway. The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s. We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.
We managed to get some local currency from the ATM. Strangely, it also dispensed USD. We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.

      We discovered Marblehead sort of by accident. Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of it from an obscure television series in the late-80s called Marblehead Manor, which happened to star the then-equally obscure Michael Richards. One weekend we decided that it was too early to call it a night, so we took off on a drive out of Boston in a general northeasterly direction. We found ourselves at Revere Beach, which was deserted, and continued on Route 1A north to Lynn.

      Winter dragged its feel longer than usual this year. The first day of spring came and went, yet the dreariness continued well into April. There was even a minor snow storm on April Fool&rsquo;s Day, bringing to mind the epic blizzard of 1997. I remember that one well, having worked through the night to finish a problem set, only to find that class had been canceled and normally busy Memorial Drive had turned into a white graveyard.

      Some time ago I took a software engineering class.Â For the term project we divided up into teams and worked on a project of our own choosing from beginning to end.Â Ours was an e-commerce application, the source code for which still resides on Google Code.
We were the Fantastic Five because, you&rsquo;d never guess it, there were 5 of us. I created the logo for the project.Â For the &ldquo;super-hero&rdquo; effect, it has 2 stylized F&rsquo;s, made to look like wings flanking a shield.

      The task of selecting a name for this blog site was reduced to finding a number, since all the sensible permutations involving my first and last name have already been claimed.Â The number 73 comes to mind.Â As Sheldon pontificated in Big Bang Theory (season 4, episode 10), 73 is the &ldquo;best number&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s the 21st prime number, whose mirror is 37, which is the 12th prime number, whose mirror is 21, which is the product of 7 and 3.
