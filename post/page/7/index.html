      In my Visual Studio project, I want to run an external executable, SQLMetal, in a build event. The only problem is that the location of the executable depends on whether the machine runs x64 or 32-bit Windows. It is found in the Program Files (x86) folder on x64 Windows and Program Files on 32-bit Windows. I want to be able to build the project without modification in either environment.
The solution is to specify the location of the Program Files dynamically by inserting the following lines in the .

      I&rsquo;m using an implementation of PagedList based on that given by Rob Conery.
I want to convert a paged list of business objects to a paged list of view model objects with AutoMapper. In order for AutoMapper to work in this case, it needs to know how to convert a paged list. This can be done with a custom type converter:
public class PagedListConverter : ITypeConverter&lt;PagedList&lt;Person&gt;, PagedList&lt;PersonViewModel&gt;&gt; { public PagedList&lt;PersonViewModel&gt; Convert(ResolutionContext context) { var models = (PagedList&lt;Person&gt;)context.

        Stack overflow exception when MVC View and Partial View have the same name

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This scenario is probably unusual but it did happen to me. I had a view named Foo.aspx and partial view named Foo.ascx. The view rendered the partial as follows:
&lt;% Html.RenderPartial(&#34;Foo&#34;); %&gt; When attempting to load the view, ASP.NET spins for a while then eventually throws a stack overflow exception. Apparently when executing the above statement, MVC searches for files named &ldquo;Foo&rdquo;, including the view itself. It must have attempted to render the view and gone into a recursive loop.

      In my former Wordpress blog, I used the excellent NextGen plugin to manage images in galleries. When embedded in a post, the gallery is rendered as thumbnails, whose full-size version is shown as an overlay when clicked. I also like to embed inline images so that I can include a caption. Inline images, however, are still directly linked and not shown as an overlay. When viewed, it requires an additional click or two to go back to the post.

      With laser printer, scanner, Ethernet and Wifi interface rolled into one, the Brother HL-2280DW is quite a little champ. However, for me, getting the Wifi to work was a bit of a challenge. The installer would die silently after configuring Wifi but without having installed the software. After some trial and error, I was able to successfully install for Ethernet . With the software installed, I was able to configure Wifi afterward.

      Today the Bruins appeared at the White House where President Obama greeted them and honored their accomplishments as 2011 Stanley Cup champions. Included in the group photo were Americans, Canadians, Czechs, a Slovak, a Finn, and a German. Notable in his absence was Bruins goalie Tim Thomas, Stanley Cup playoffs MVP, winner of multiple awards and the only American player who made significant contribution to the team&rsquo;s Cup run. The details of Thomas' absence are covered elsewhere, but it has become clear that it is politically motivated.

        Modifying SQL Server table without dropping and recreating it

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The SQL Server Designer is a nice visual tool for making modifications to a table. However, when you save the changes, SQL Server actually drops the entire table and then recreates it (if there are data in the table, they would be retained). This happens even if the changes made do not actually require that the table be re-created. This is presumably so that SQL Server can accommodate all possible types of modification.

      I have an HTC Aria which runs now-ancient Android 2.1. This phone is far from being the latest and greatest, to put it mildly, but I like its small form factor. After putting up with it for a year, I have had enough and decided to upgrade it to Gingerbread. This is how I did it. As this is my first attempt, no doubt there are different and better ways to do things.

      In Visual Studio, it&rsquo;s easy enough to turn on and off line numbers. You&rsquo;ll have to select Tools &gt; Options &gt; Text Editor, expand the language of choice, select General, then toggle Line numbers under the Display section. This can get tedious if you want to be able to show and hide line numbers at will. To turn this process into a single click, you can record custom macros to show and hide line numbers.
