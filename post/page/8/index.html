      We&rsquo;re using MSBuild in Hudson as part of our continuous integration process. We put the MSBuild scripts in the same directory as the Visual Studio solution file. Everything has been working well until until we decided, as an experiment, to put the MSBuild scripts in a separate directory from the solution. Then the build process started to fail with error MSB3202, &ldquo;the project file was not found&rdquo;.
By using MSBuild&rsquo;s &ldquo;/verbosity:diagnostic&rdquo; flag, we were able to look at the list of properties that MSBuild was using.

      We&rsquo;re using AutoMapper in ASP.NET MVC automate the mapping of properties between entity and view model objects. This is a highly useful tool which helps us avoid the tedium of having to assigning properties manually. Here&rsquo;s a good introduction to using AutoMapper.
In one case, I find that the AutoMapper doesn&rsquo;t work for all properties. One property in particular doesn&rsquo;t get mapped. If I manually assign a value to it as a test, I would get a ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException.

Few places in Boston are as beautiful as Mount Auburn Cemetery. While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel. It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park. While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Broadmoor is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary. Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet. Despite sounding like something out of The Hounds of the Baskervilles, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River. In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.
Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.

      As far as big mountain goes,[ Mount Monadnock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock&quot; targtet=&quot;_blank) in the southwestern corner of New Hampshire is relatively close to Boston. Despite its proximity, we&rsquo;ve never set foot on it. So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.
Monadnock&rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US. Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      George RR Martin&rsquo;s Song of Ice and Fire series receives almost universal acclaim from reviewers. I picked up A Game of Thrones after seeing it recommended by several reviewers. Since it is billed as the entry into an epic fantasy series, I half-expected to see a fantastic world populated by magic wielders and magical creations. Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin&rsquo;s medieval universe.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      With this third hit in a row, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The Baldur&rsquo;s Gate franchise is the most popular single-player RPG series out there for good reasons, even though it&rsquo;s been a few years since its release. While more recent Black Isle games, notably Icewind Dale II, have vastly improved graphics and interface and others like Neverwinter Nights have changed the playing field entirely, BGII stands out for its tremendous scope and exceptional depth. BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Canon&rsquo;s S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots. Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous. The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use.

      It&rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do.
