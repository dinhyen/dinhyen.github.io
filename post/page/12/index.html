      File this as another in the category of &ldquo;places I&rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&rdquo;. This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike. The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &ldquo;the shot heard around the world&rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road. On a nice day, you&rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.

      Every season in Boston has its own riveting appeal. The fall is not only the most beautiful of seasons, but it also marks the start of the hockey season and, for non-hockey fans, the annual Head of the Charles Regatta. In 2010, the Regatta took place on a chilly weekend in late October (this was Boston, after all). For me, there was nothing better than to put on a warm jacket, hop on the bike for the half-hour ride to Harvard University, then snap away.

      Last Friday, we visited the Chihuly exhibit at the MFA. Like most people, I strained to find familiar words to describe something unfamiliar (during those moments when my mind wasn&rsquo;t occupied with playing over and over the disastrous scenario of inadvertently knocking something down). Here are some of the ones I came up with. But sometimes, you just have to admit that there isn&rsquo;t a word.

      Would you expect any less from a die-hard hockey fan? So with a warning that this is going to be shamelessly biased, here goes.
 At the 2011 NHL All-Stars game, NY Islanders forward Michael Grabner won the Fastest Skater competition with a time of 14.238 seconds. The track length is about 550 ft. This translates to 38.6 ft or 12.9 yards/second. For comparison, let&rsquo;s look at the fastest 40-yard dash for football players, who are speedsters in their own right.

      I&rsquo;ve been discovering more and more of the amazing gems that are the Audubon sanctuaries. Recently I visited the Ipswich River sanctuary and the Broadmoor sanctuary, both of which are amazing for the scenery and wildlife they contain. Yet I&rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner. The Habitat sanctuary is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.

      Boston&rsquo;s first Stanley Cup parade in 39 years was going to take place on Saturday, June 18, three days after the team celebrated on the ice in Vancouver. It was as definitive a &ldquo;clear your calendar&rdquo;-type event as it will ever be. On the morning of C-day, we got up early, loaded up with a hearty breakfast, filled the caffeine meter, and made sure we went to the bathroom before heading down to the T.

      Zdeno Chara grabbed hold of the Cup, reverently brought it to his lips, then raised it above his head, repeating a ritual performed by all previous Cup-winning captains. The only difference was that it had not been done by someone wearing the spoked-B since Nixon was President. The events of this night surely sent Bruins fans everywhere into a delirium. For the entire time that the Bruins celebrated on the ice, I had a stupidly wide grin on my face.

      It&rsquo;s the eve before the biggest game in my history as a Bruins fan. I&rsquo;m so nervous I&rsquo;m going to have problem going to sleep. I had known about hockey quite early on since Las Vegas had a minor-league team, the now-defunct Las Vegas Thunder, and a friend was a big fan. Despite knowing so little about the game, I was hooked immediately when I came to Boston in the mid-90s.

      TD Bank Garden, Boston on June 8, around 19:00. It was moments before Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals between the Boston Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks. In the darkened arena, packed to the rafters with almost 18000 screaming fans, the lone spotlight descended on an area in the stands. Momentarily, a middle-aged man clad in a vintage Bruins jersey stepped into the light. The crowd erupted. It was none other than the legendary Bobby Orr, the man universally regarded as the finest defenseman in the history of hockey.

Tilajari Resort sits right on the bank of the San Carlos River. We woke up to the chattering sounds of birds. As we ambled to breakfast we could see the brown river glimmering just beyond a gently sloping lawn. The fruit section at breakfast was par excellence.
