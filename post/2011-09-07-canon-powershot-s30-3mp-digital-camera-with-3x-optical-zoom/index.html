    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Canon&rsquo;s S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots. Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous. The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use. Lastly, it&rsquo;s a great deal considering its price-feature ratio.</p>
<p>The S30 includes the usual automatic presets such as landscape and portrait, but also offers the semi-automatic and fully manual modes that a serious photographer would want. The following adjustments may come in handy: 1) film speed from ASA-equivalent 50 to 800, 2) spot, center-weighted and evaluative metering modes, 3) three selectable autofocus areas, 4) exposure compensation between -2 and 2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV, 5) continuous drive mode (though maxing out at a modest 2.5fps), 6) macro mode. While I still prefer an SLR in most situations, the S30 fills many of my needs very nicely. I use the it to take preview or experimental shots or to take shots that I would hesitate to blow film on. Morever, the S30 makes your job a cinch when it comes to panoramas. The panoramic mode shows you a third of the previous frame, either vertical or horizontal, which is an invaluable guide to help you line up the current frame. I used to have to spend a lot of time in Photoshop to line up adjacent frames and erase the seams between frames. Canon&rsquo;s Photostitch software does all of that and more, at the click of a button!</p>
<p>Picture quality is very good, with excellent sharpness throughout the image and no noticeable softness in the corners at wide-angle. Macro shots are very sharp, to the point that I decided to do close-ups primarily with the S30. Colors can be a little flat, but this can be easily fixed in Photoshop. There is a special &ldquo;Vivid&rdquo; or saturated mode, but this comes at the expense of losing other controls over the shot. I&rsquo;ve noticed that the dynamic range for the CCD sensor is quite low, much worse than for color negatives or slides. This is most apparent if you&rsquo;ve got a mixed light and dark scene; either the sky would be washed out or the foreground would be underexposed. This could be a shortcoming of CCDs in general and not one particular to the S30.</p>
<p>The S30&rsquo;s 3-megapixels resolution is good enough for a 2048x1536 image, which in turn is sufficient for 8x10 enlargements. If this is not large enough for your needs, the S40 ups the ante to 4 megapixels. There is a USB jack for downloading images and an A/V jack for previewing images on TV. You will want to invest in a CF card-reader however, for convenience&rsquo;s sake. The storage slot takes Type I or II CF cards, and also accommodates a Microdrive.</p>
<p>The S30&rsquo;s compact size is its greatest asset, but is also responsible for a few shortcomings. The 1.8&quot; LCD screen is bright and contrasty, but only indoors. Lacking a swivel and anti-glare coating, it&rsquo;s virtually useless outdoors. You may have to resort to the optical viewfinder, which does not cover 100 percent of the image. The LCD displays most useful information, but inexplicably lacks a battery life indicator. You&rsquo;d have no idea how much power is left until the low-battery indicator flashes. To make matters worse, the rechargeable Li-Ion battery has rather short lifespan, between 30-50 shots. I have to carry 2 spare batteries in order to shoot for a whole day. The thumb-operated directional controller is rather awkward to use. You scroll to move up/down and press to move left/right. To select, you have to press down on the middle. In my case, to hit select, I had to learn a way to press it just right, otherwise the controller would move left or right instead. Lastly, while this may not matter much to most people, I frequently use a tripod, which blocks the battery cover and makes changing battery quite a hassle.</p>
<p>Despite its shortcomings, I&rsquo;ve found the S30 to be an indispensable companion. I&rsquo;ve had it for almost a year and taken it with me on trips to Asia and throughout western North America. At times I yearned for a more advanced camera like the Canon G2 or even a digital SLR, but more often than not I found myself thankful that I was able to take pictures I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken otherwise with a larger camera. The S30 has more than paid for itself.</p>
