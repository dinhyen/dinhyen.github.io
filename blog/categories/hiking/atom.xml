    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214490968088440958659.0004c64105f39ce5af613&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-13.164572,-72.534914&amp;spn=0.040576,0.053816">Map</a> of our hike to Intipunku, the Inca Bridge and down to Aguas Calientes (the GPS track recorded by the logger is a little out of sync with Google Map, but you get the idea).</p>

<p>Had Machu Picchu been built in Cusco, it would have been just as spectacular.  But being perched on a remote mountaintop, invisible from below, covered by swirling mists, and (when &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by Hiram Bingham) overrun by the jungle gives it an unmatched mystique.  It is the classic definition of a long-forgotten ruins.  Yet in its heydays, Machu Picchu must have been a lively place. Particularly during festivals and celebrations, it must have been occupied by many priests, warriors, members of the royalty, and common people, all bedecked in the colorful attire that their descendants still wear today. The story of the fall of the Incas is a tragic one, from the betrayal of the last sovereign emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atahualpa">Atahualpa</a> to the decimation of the native population by the foreign disease of smallpox to the last stand of the Incas in the jungles at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilcabamba,_Peru">Vilcabamba</a>.  Of all of the legacy of their civilization, Machu Picchu is perhaps the crown jewel.  But on a happier note, while their architectural and engineering knowledge may have been forgotten, their language Quechua is very much alive and well, being spoken by many modern Peruvians.  Some of their cultural traditions also survive, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inti_Raymi">Inti Raymi</a>, the Festival of the Sun, celebrated annually in Cusco and more importantly in indigenous areas throughout the old empire.</p>

<p>At Machu Picchu, the Incas must have been just as much in awe of this wondrous landscape as are we.  Yet being worshippers of nature and seemingly possessing an innate connection to it,  they were able to create something that is not only in complete harmony with its natural setting but more than matches its beauty.  Whether it&rsquo;s a royal retreat, religious center or military outpost is immaterial.  If there&rsquo;s anything whose beauty redefines its purpose, this is it.  Whereas in modern America we may be tempted to build a parking lot and perhaps a viewing platform, the Incas have given humanity something that will remain unexceeded by our creativity and imagination.</p>

<p>Before coming to Peru, I&rsquo;ve seen many photos of the classic view of Machu Picchu and formed a fairly detailed mental map.  But nothing could have prepared me for the beauty of the real thing.   Words or pictures fail to do it justice.  You may be there at sunrise, mid-day and sunset, when it&rsquo;s sunny, foggy and rainy.  You may spend hours being immersed in its surroundings. You may climb all of its peaks and explore all of its corners.  Yet in the end, it would still seem somehow unreal, as if it&rsquo;s a mythical place that would fade away into the mist as soon as you look away.</p>

<p>Machu Picchu is built on top of a mountain, which is itself surrounded by much taller peaks. It is like the center of a flower, surrounded by petals.  At sunrise, the complex would remain swathed in shadows, until the sun rises high enough to surmount the surrounding peaks and bathe it in a golden light.  At certain times during the year, notably the summer soltice, sun light first falls on the complex at its highest point, Intihuatana or &ldquo;Hitching Post of the Sun&rdquo;.  The sun-worshipping Incas held their most important ceremonies on such occasions.</p>

<p>Machu Picchu is only reachable by train or on foot.  The closest train station is at Ollantaytambo, a worthy destination in its own right.  The alternative, the famed Inca trail, follows the footsteps of the Incas and traverses mountains to reach Machu Picchu.  It is quite crowded these days, but the trek would still be an experience of a lifetime.  The train stops at the town of Aguas Calientes (officially, Machu Picchu Pueblo) which lies at the foot of the mountain and exists almost solely as a hub for exploring Machu Picchu.  From here, a road zigzags up the mountain through several switchbacks to reach the ancient city.</p>

<p>From Cusco we were picked up at our hotel by a Lima Tours van at 5am, which arrived after a couple of hours in Ollantaytambo.  Here we embarked on a Peru Rail train.  We paid extra for a seat on the so-called Vista Dome car, with skylight which provided a view of the majestic Andes mountains.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2247.jpg' /></p>

<p>The railroad runs alongside the rushing Urubamba river, the artery of the Sacred Valley, sometimes coming perilously close to it.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2361.jpg' /></p>

<p>Along the way we were treated to views of snow-covered peaks.  The highland is sparse in vegetation but rich in Inca heritage. We saw many Inca ruins from the train, sometimes interspersed with modern additions.  We can only marvel at how many must be out there, hidden from sight.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2327.jpg' /></p>

<p>The Inca trail also runs parallel to the river and occasionally comes into view.  The train stopped along the way to drop off a handful of passengers who were going on a day hike to Machu Picchu. Later that day as we checked into our hotel, they stumbled into the lobby, exhausted. The rain forest appeared and became thicker the closer we got to Aguas Calientes.  Then we caught sight of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi%C3%B1ay_Wayna">Wiñay Wayna</a>.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2376.jpg' /></p>

<p>This photo from inside a moving train completely failed to do it justice. This amazing temple to water is constructed, appropriately, next to a waterfalls rushing down the mountainside.</p>

<p>Aguas Calientes is a tiny town that tries to squeeze between the river and the mountain.  As expected, it&rsquo;s longer than it&rsquo;s wide.  Buildings climb on top of each other or crowd over narrow alleys. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be a Latin American city without a town square. Occupying the center of the square is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachacuti">Pachacútec</a>, the &ldquo;builder&rdquo; Inca for whom Machu Picchu is believed to be constructed.  Appropriately, there&rsquo;s a much larger monument to this great Inca in Cusco.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3051.jpg' /></p>

<p>Our package provided for bus and entrance tickets for 2 days as well as a guided tour.  We wasted no time to meet with our guide and hop on the next shuttle to Machu Picchu. After making it past the throngs at the entrance (around 10am) and getting the requisite Machu Picchu stamp for our passport, we&rsquo;re officially in Machu Picchu.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2390.jpg' /></p>

<p>At long last, the sight we had been waiting for.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2425a.jpg' /></p>

<p>Walking toward the famed Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2426.jpg' /></p>

<p>The temple seems to grow out of the rock rather than being built on top of it. This is just one example of Inca construct blending in perfect harmony with nature.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2437.jpg' /></p>

<p>Looking back at the so-called Caretaker&rsquo;s Hut, which overlooks the entire complex.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2568.jpg' /></p>

<p>View of Intihuatana, the focal point of the complex.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2710a.jpg' /></p>

<p>View from Intihuatana, with the Principal Temple and House of the Priest in the foreground.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2506.jpg' /></p>

<p>As advertised, Machu Picchu is surrounded by mountains, with dome-like Putukusi in the foreground.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2507a.jpg' /></p>

<p>The ceremonial Intihuatana.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2518.jpg' /></p>

<p>View through the Temple of the Three Windows.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2867.jpg' /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a herd of llamas roaming freely around the complex. This baby llama got separated.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2841.jpg' /></p>

<p>Huayna Picchu, the mountain seen in the classic view of Machu Picchu. Behind the huts is the entrance.  For climbing it.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2535a.jpg' /></p>

<p>Amazingly, Huayna Picchu is terraced all the way to the top, as these hikers discovered.  This  incredible feat of engineering also creates a jaw-dropping vantage point. Unfortunately a reservation is required to enter, so we have to wait until next time.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2706.jpg' /></p>

<p>The &ldquo;classic&rdquo; view of Machu Picchu (I think).</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2700.jpg' /></p>

<p>The privileged Royal District which surrounds the Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2733.jpg' /></p>

<p>The lesser residential and warehouse district, dubbed the &ldquo;Mortar District&rdquo; by our guidebook due it being more &ldquo;crudely&rdquo; constructed using mortar.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2731.jpg' /></p>

<p>The official and only gate to Machu Picchu.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2735.jpg' /></p>

<p>Just how steep are the terraces?</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2648.jpg' /></p>

<p>View inside the Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2782.jpg' /></p>

<p>Underneath the Temple of the Sun are intricate alcoves and niches, which a fertile imagination may want to believe to be a sacrificial chamber (it is not).</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2817.jpg' /></p>

<p>The Temple of Condor with spreading V-shaped wings and a triangular head in the foreground. I think the curved stone in front of the head was used to hold offerings.  Underneath the wings is low cave reachable from a narrow slit in the rock.  The cave exits via another entrance in the back of the temple.  A sacrificial chamber?  Maybe.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3010.jpg' /></p>

<p>Incredibly, an aqueduct system is built into the terraces. The one shown here begins somewhere above the Temple of the Sun and winds its way through channels carved into the rocks.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3039.jpg' /></p>

<p>The fountain flows into the stone basin below. As you can plainly see, it still works!</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2818.jpg' /></p>

<p>Nowadays, one of the few native denizens here is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscacha">viscacha</a>, an Andean rodent related to chinchillas.  I wonder how it tastes&hellip;</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_2978.jpg' /></p>

<p>As the sun went down, our last view from Machu Picchu on the first day was this.  The wedge-shaped Putukusi is sacred to the Incas. There is a trail up the steeply sloped mountain, and a rainbow Inca flag proudly flies on top.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3048.jpg' /></p>

<p>The next day, we wanted to catch the sunrise.  Luckily, <a href="http://www.elmapihotel.com">El Mapi Hotel</a> (MaPi is plainly a portmanteau for you-know-what) starts serving breakfast at 4:30, so obviously we&rsquo;re not the only ones to have this idea.  Despite the early rise, the sumptuous buffet full of fruit and fresh ingredients was perhaps my best hotel breakfast ever.  We made it to the bus stop a little before 5:30, which is when the bus starts running, but there was already a long line!</p>

<p>Our route today was the Inca trail. Well, the part of it that goes down to Machu Picchu.  After its long and spectacular journey, the Inca trail arrives at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intipuncu">Intipunku</a> or &ldquo;Sun Gate&rdquo;.  It is from this commanding position that visitors get the first glimpse of the city in all its glory.</p>

<p>To reach the Inca trail, we took the first left after entering the main gate and immediately climbed uphill. Soon we reached the terraces that continue just below the Caretaker&rsquo;s Hut. Naturally we stopped for a photo of the city still in slumber.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3056.jpg' /></p>

<p>The trail starts going uphill and doesn&rsquo;t let up.  At the half-way mark there is a &ldquo;rest station&rdquo;.  The view is spectacular the whole way.  We ran into hikers going the other way who were on the last leg of their journey.  Finally arriving at Intipunku, we found a crowd.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3275.jpg' /></p>

<p>But I think we rather enjoyed the view.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3110.jpg' /></p>

<p>Needless to say, the view will knock your socks off.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3198.jpg' /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re just as impressed with the Inca trail itself, even after everything we had seen till that point.  It&rsquo;s a wall 6 feet high, perfectly straight and even, with so few cracks that vegetation could not grow on it.  This road looks as if it would last for millenniums.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3324.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what appears to be a stone quarry right next to the trail.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3327.jpg' /></p>

<p>There is also entrance to climb Machu Picchu&mdash;the mountain&mdash;which is the other end of the &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; on which the city sits.  It is much higher than Huayna Picchu. Unfortunately, to enter also requires a reservation.</p>

<p>Just when we thought we had seen everything, we decided to check out the little-mentioned Inca Bridge. We had no idea what it was.  Little did we realize that we were in for a trip.  The trail, very similar in construction to the Inca trail, goes around the other side of Machu Picchu mountain.  In short order we saw the hydroelectric project just out of view from the city.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3355.jpg' /></p>

<p>Soon it got very interesting.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3363.jpg' /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing but a wall, albeit not just any but a sturdy <em>Inca</em> wall, between you and a very long fall.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3381.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here the trail bridges two rocky outposts.  For support, the builders had to construct a 100-foot high stone wall on a sheer cliff.  This is stupendous feat.  I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe it.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3392.jpg' /></p>

<p>We finally arrived at the Inca Bridge, which is another engineering marvel.  From below, it must seem that we&rsquo;re half-way up the cliff face, walking in mid-air.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3458.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the trail, with the wall strategically placed to prevent us from certain death.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3470.jpg' /></p>

<p>Being so high literally takes your breath away.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3482.jpg' /></p>

<p>The lush river gorge far below.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3488.jpg' /></p>

<p>The view is to die for, but perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t put it that way.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3494.jpg' /></p>

<p>A final glimpse of Machu Picchu. It truly is a wonder of the world.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3503a.jpg' /></p>

<p>We decided to return to Aguas Calientes via the trail, which begins next to the entrance.  Seeing this, one of the young fellows selling postcards asked if we&rsquo;re taking the trail. He then held up a package of postcards he was selling.  I didn&rsquo;t understand what he wanted at first, but it then dawned on me that he was asking for our tickets, which we wouldn&rsquo;t need, and offering a quid pro quo. Bus tickets are quite expensive by local standards, with a round trip costing S/.45 ($15). No doubt these poor fellows had to go on foot in order to keep what meager money they were making.  So we doubled back and gave him both of our tickets.</p>

<p>The trail consists of evenly hewn stone steps all the way down, although it is modern and not Inca.  The view was mostly obscured, but quite nice when we did get it.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3542.jpg' /></p>

<p>An unexpected and much welcome encounter with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-crowned_Motmot">blue-crowned motmot</a>.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3587.jpg' /></p>

<p>It was lovely when we got down to the river.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3620.jpg' /></p>

<p>Even Aguas Calientes looked pretty from a distance.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3626.jpg' /></p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at a restaurant, Toto&rsquo;s House, which sits with its haunch hanging over the river.  It was a meal with a view.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3657.jpg' /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s our train.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3664.jpg' /></p>

<p>To get to the train station we had to pass through a market, similar to the one in <a href="http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/pisac-peru/">Písac</a>.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3678.jpg' /></p>

<p>The train staff channeled their thespian side and put on a fashion and stage show for us.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-machu-picchu/dsc_3696.jpg' /></p>

<p>We were picked up in Ollantaytambo by a taxi driver, who delivered us to almost to our hotel in Cusco and even taught us a few words of Quechua.  We would see him again.</p>

<p>Machu Picchu is an indescribable experience. We only hope this won&rsquo;t be the last time.</p>

    <id>http://dinhyen.github.io/blog/2012/07/19/pisac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214490968088440958659.0004c5275f92d3e0e1cb8&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-13.41329,-71.844814&amp;spn=0.020267,0.020471">Map</a> of our walking route of Písac.</p>

<p>Most people know about Cusco and Machu Picchu, but there&rsquo;s so much more.  Stretched between the two is the valley formed by the Urubamba (or Vilcanota) river, the so-called Sacred Valley of the Incas.  Inca settlements, temples and monuments are found through the valley and towns such as Písac and Ollantaytambo are home to spectacular ruins.  Those who are up for an outdoor experience can even take the Inca trail, the ancient highway to Machu Picchu.  Písac is closest to Cusco, about 30km, and there are several ruins on the outskirts of Cusco on the way to Písac.  So we opted to come here and work our way back.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t get much sleep the previous night thanks to the discotheque next to the hotel. Trying to fight off fatigue, we nevertheless managed to be on our way around 9:30.  We flagged a taxi in the plaza and agreed on a price (S/.45).  As usual, the driver quoted something higher than our target price, and we had to bargain it down to a more reasonable level.</p>

<p>The drive is quite scenic and takes us through rolling hills, farmlands, pine forests and mountain passes between towering peaks.  We asked the taxi driver to stop for this view near Písac.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1674.jpg' /></p>

<p>Písac is known for its market, which is the most popular in the Sacred Valley.  Stalls fill the entire main square and spill into the surrounding alleys.  You can find everything here, particularly woven items, handicrafts and jewelries.  We found Kate a cute little hat to help ward off the sun.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1693.jpg' /></p>

<p>We even found this guinea pig condos in a courtyard. Unfortunately, these cute little guys were destined for lunch.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1711.jpg' /></p>

<p>The town is clustered around the river, while the ruins are perched on the peaks above it.  To get there, you can either hike up the trail or take a taxi (taxis are found next to the bridge you have to cross to enter town).  We decided to take the taxi for S/.25.  It turned out our taxi driver was a woman, the only one in Písac according to her and the only one we saw the entire trip.</p>

<p>The taxi dropped us off at the back entrance to a hill-top ruins complex known as Qanchisracay, one of four arrayed along the mountain ridge.  Multi-storied stone houses appear to be used for habitation or storage.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1755.jpg' /></p>

<p>The stones are roughly hewn. Ah, so not all Inca stonework are created equal. The largest stones and the highest quality are reserved for religious, royal and other important structures.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1772.jpg' /></p>

<p>Outlooks provide a sweeping view of the valley below.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1749.jpg' /></p>

<p>Across the wide agricultural terraces known as Andenes is the second complex, Q'allaqasa, which is more imposing and looks as if carved out of the mountain side.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1759.jpg' /></p>

<p>Q'allaqasa was intended as a citadel.  Q'allaqasa may not seem very large from a distance, but once you&rsquo;re inside, it feels much more substantial.  Rooms are stacked on top of each other and winding, multi-level passageways create the impression of a maze. We later found this experience to be true at Machu Picchu as well.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1803.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here, across the top, we see the trail to the religious complex, Intihuatana.  Visible at the lower left is the fourth complex, Pisaqa.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1766.jpg' /></p>

<p>The trail involves some climbing.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1835.jpg' /></p>

<p>This is the trapezoidal doorway considered to be the main entrance, named Amarupunku (amaru = snake, punku = doorway). Later on we&rsquo;d see a similar one at Machu Picchu.</p>

<p>View from the citadel.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1895.jpg' /></p>

<p>After exploring Q'allaqasa, we were both tired, hungry and running low on water, so we decided to head down to town.  In retrospect, we should have forged on to the other ruins, which are much more impressive.  The Intihuatana complex in particular includes a sun temple as well as its namesake, the &ldquo;hitching post of the sun&rdquo;.  Something for next time.</p>

<p>The most direct trail to the town, which terminates right below the citadel, is an attraction in itself.  We first passed by some terraces with built-in stone steps.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1924.jpg' /></p>

<p>The trail runs along a rugged canyon.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1932.jpg' /></p>

<p>We passed by rows of what seemed like small houses built into the cliff face high above&mdash;an Inca burial site.  This is such a remarkable way to to build graves, but by now we didn&rsquo;t expect any less from the Incas.  Unfortunately, their precipitous placement did not deter thieves, and all of the graves have holes in them, an obvious sign that they were broken into by robbers.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1969.jpg' /></p>

<p>We were surrounded by mountains and enthralled by views of the fantastic terraces high above (or below in this case).</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_1951.jpg' /></p>

<p>This is quite a spectacular hike and worth every céntimo.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2003.jpg' /></p>

<p>Intihuatana is unfortunately obscured just behind this peak.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2016.jpg' /></p>

<p>This guy is hiking around the Torreones (towers).</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2022.jpg' /></p>

<p>Terraces abound.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2064.jpg' /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite amazing to actually be walking on same path as the Incas did centuries ago.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2068.jpg' /></p>

<p>The terraces are taller than they seem.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2073.jpg' /></p>

<p>Finally we made it down to town. This entrance is just 30 seconds up an alley from the market.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2082.jpg' /></p>

<p>Food and relief came at the first restaurant we saw, which faces the plaza and market.  The back and upper floor serve as a hotel, which seems pretty nice. Staying here would give us plenty of time to explore the ruins, something to think about.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/peru-pisac/dsc_2085.jpg' /></p>

<p>After Písac we headed back to Cusco as the locals do, by taking a minibus called a <em>colectivo</em>.</p>

Straight and level, it&rsquo;s hardly a challenging hike.  Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.</p>

<p>Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high. Nevertheless, the chance to admire the landscape of craggy cliffs carved into by innumerable bays and inlets and pounded by the relentless waves is well worth the risk.  For me, Great Head brings back memories of Point Lobos Reserve in Carmel, California.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214490968088440958659.0004c472e0af882101443&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=44.358347,-68.211794&amp;spn=0.014897,0.018775">Map</a> of our round-trip hike to Dorr Mountain from Sieur de Monts.</p>

<p>Dorr Mountain is the second highest peak on Mount Desert Island, behind only Cadillac Mountain. It&rsquo;s named after George Dorr, who&rsquo;s affectionately known as the father of Acadia National Park. There are multiple paths to the summit.  We chose to start from Sieur de Monts spring.</p>

<p>There are a couple of trails crisscrossing the area.  The most obvious is Emery Path, which begins right behind the small visitors' center.  Another possible starting point is nearby Homans' Path, which is built by Dorr himself and deemed even more scenic by our guidebook. As it turned out, we loved every bit of Emery Path.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5511.jpg' /></p>

<p>The path quickly ascends on a series of evenly-laid stone steps.  This turns out to be one of the outstanding features of this trail.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5518.jpg' /></p>

<p>Soon the trail narrows to a slit in the rocks, which we must squeeze through.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5523.jpg' /></p>

<p>Looking down.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5524.jpg' /></p>

<p>The workmanship is impressive.  Several times I was tempted to make comparison with the Inca trails on which we&rsquo;d hiked in Peru.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5532.jpg' /></p>

<p>We ascended this long staircase to reach the first overlook.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5549.jpg' /></p>

<p>Which proffers a beautiful view of the Great Meadow and beyond.  Here&rsquo;s a close-up view of Bar Island, site of the former Dorr estate and now a part of the park.  It is reachable from the mainland via a land bridge which is exposed at low tide or of course by boat.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5553.jpg' /></p>

<p>Next up was a dramatic curving section which hugs the side of the mountain with a precipitous drop on the other side.  It may be a bit unnerving to those who are uncomfortable with heights.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5558.jpg' /></p>

<p>View from the other side, with Huguenot Head in the background.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5565.jpg' /></p>

<p>But even acrophobes would love the view.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5559.jpg' /></p>

<p>Just after the cliff, we passed the junction with Homan&rsquo;s Path.  The stone steps actually make it fun to climb uphill.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5587.jpg' /></p>

<p>Soon it began to level out a bit.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5589.jpg' /></p>

<p>After about 0.5 mile, we came to the end of Emery Path. The right fork is Schiff Path while the left is Kurt Diederich&rsquo;s Climb.  The latter bears the distinction of being the steepest trail in the park, with an altitude change of 450 feet in only 0.5 mile. Since it goes downhill from here, we&rsquo;d have to tackle it at another time.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5595.jpg' /></p>

<p>Schiff Path is scenic in its own right.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5606.jpg' /></p>

<p>The next junction is with the Ladder Trail.  This is yet another way to ascend Dorr Mountain. It requires clambering up a couple of &ldquo;ladders&rdquo;&mdash;iron rungs bolted into the rock.  We&rsquo;ll have to make another date for it.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5619.jpg' /></p>

<p>Soon we entered the woods and began to see the Acadia cairns with regularity.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5635.jpg' /></p>

<p>The bald spots showcase the famous Acadia pink granite.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5641.jpg' /></p>

<p>It looks like the summit here, but it&rsquo;s not.  The summit is 0.1 mi further away down the Dorr South Ridge Trail.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5642.jpg' /></p>

<p>Over a shallow valley we could see the summit of Cadillac Mountain and its concomitant crowd. On Dorr Mountain, there were exactly us and a Park Service student volunteer whose job was to count the number of hikers who reach the summit.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5648.jpg' /></p>

<p>To get back down, we took Dorr North Ridge Trail.  The exposed ridge offers some splendid views.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5661.jpg' /></p>

<p>Going down was tougher.  We had to carefully descend this long rock slide full of large boulders.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5686.jpg' /></p>

<p>After a mile we reached the Hemlock Trail.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5687.jpg' /></p>

<p>Which features an impressive dark tunnel of hemlock trees. As you can imagine, we had to fend off the army of mosquitoes which lay in ambush here.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5694.jpg' /></p>

<p>After a short descent, we reached the wide graveled Hemlock path, which leads back to the visitors' center.</p>

<p><img src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/acadia-dorr/dsc_5698.jpg' /></p>
