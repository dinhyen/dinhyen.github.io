    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another unique feature of Acadia is the extensive system of carriage roads.  Built in the first half of the 20th century by the Rockefeller family for use by horses and carriages, these roads traverse Mount Desert Island and offer unparalleled access to the its interior.  These are possibly the most scenic bike paths anywhere. Due to its length of more than 45 miles, the carriage roads are best experienced on a bicycle. This is the activity that we&rsquo;ve done most often and I&rsquo;m happy to say we&rsquo;ve biked most of the carriage roads here (some are outside the park proper and off-limits to bicycles).</p>

<p>We sometimes bring our own bike, but our preference is to rent a tandem bike from <a href="www.barharborbike.com">Bar Harbor Bike shop</a>.  Not only is it more fun, the tandem makes going up hill much easier.  From the shop, some people take their bikes to the park on an Island Shuttle. The shuttle, which can accommodate regular (not tandem) bikes on a rack mounted on the front, is a free and convenient way to get around the park.  We prefer to bike directly to the park via Duck Brook access road.  We typically make a half-time pit stop at Jordan Pond to have lunch and recharge before making the journey back.  This time we also take a detour to Day Mountain, which is the only mountain whose summit is reached by a carriage road.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214490968088440958659.0004c4200155b511f3874&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=44.340425,-68.243294&amp;spn=0.119212,0.127201">map</a> of the route we took.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once you reach the terminus of the Minuteman Bikeway at Bedford Railroad Depot, most people turn around and head back.  It&rsquo;s understandable, because it&rsquo;s a 10.5 mile ride back to Alewife Station in Cambridge.  If I&rsquo;m on a road bike, this is usually a water stop on the way to the northwest suburbs (Concord, Carlisle, Chelmsford, etc).  However, it turns out that there other two other bike paths that start (or end) here.  One is the &ldquo;single-gauge trail&rdquo;, which is a gravel path that heads across Bedford toward Chelmsford.  The other is a 5-mile hard-packed dirt trail that terminates near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_North_Bridge">Old North Bridge</a>, an important site in the American Revolution.  As added bonus, it also runs right by the <a href="/blog/2011/06/great-meadows-national-wildlife-refuge" title="Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge">Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge</a>.  The ride is quite scenic, as it winds through forest and swamp and skirts a couple of conservation areas. I have a feeling that we will be getting to know this trail quite well.</p>

<p>The map data was recorded on my GPS tracker, which I exported to GPX format and uploaded to Google Map.</p>

    <link href="http://dinhyen.github.io/blog/2011/07/10/hub-on-wheels-2010/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dinhyen.github.io/blog/2011/07/10/hub-on-wheels-2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every September since 2005, the city of Boston has held a charity bike ride to benefit of one of its educational programs.  The event is called <a href="http://hubonwheels.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=436653">Hub on Wheels</a>, a clever pun based on Boston&rsquo;s modest nickname for itself, the <a href="http://www.boston.com/travel/boston/boston_nicknames/">Hub of the Universe</a>.  For the majority of riders, it would be the only time of the year that they get an intimate view of some of Boston&rsquo;s lesser-known neighborhoods.  There are 3 available courses, 10-, 30- and 50-mile.  I&rsquo;ve been riding the 50-mile course  since 2008.  In my experience, turnout has varied depending on Boston&rsquo;s notoriously fickle weather, which is even more unpredictable in the fall.  In 2008 the weather was great and the crowds were spectacular.  In 2009 cold, heavy rain poured and it seemed only the hardiest of riders showed up at the starting line by 8h00.</p>

<p>Since 2009, the event also has also included the so-called Mayor&rsquo;s Cup races undertaken by professional riders after the general ride.  The course encircles City Hall on cordoned-off streets.  Tour de France this isn&rsquo;t, more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>.  However, if you&rsquo;ve ever ridden a bike on Boston&rsquo;s bumpy, weather-beaten streets, you&rsquo;d know that this is no mean feat.  There are separate races for men and women, with the men riding at top speed for about 1h30.  Here are some photos from the 2010 men&rsquo;s race.  I had participated in the morning ride, gone home, eaten lunch, successfully fought the urge to take a nap, then returned downtown to catch the second half of the race.</p>
