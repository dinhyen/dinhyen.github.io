  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CHMaQ/23/">View the live example</a></p>

<p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a> is a dynamic UI framework that can really liberate you from the tedium of low-level DOM manipulations.  Even though I&rsquo;ve only played with it for a little while, I&rsquo;ve become a huge fan. One of my initial attempts is to create an animated text input similar to Twitter&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The UI is quite simple. The textbox should display a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; prompt.  When the user clicks inside the textbox, expand it and display a save button, initially disabled.  If the user types something (other than white space), enable the button.  If the textbox loses focus, shrink it to its original size, unless it contains a valid comment.</p>

<p>To show the placeholder prompt, I could use the HTML5 &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; attribute. Unfortunately this isn&rsquo;t supported by all browsers (what else but IE 9 and below). So I&rsquo;m using a div to wrap the textbox and display the prompt as an overlay.</p>

<p>The view model&rsquo;s isEditing boolean observable reflects whether the textbox has focus.  It&rsquo;s wired to the hasfocus binding on the textbox.  Additionally, clicking anywhere on the wrapper div should activate the observable, since the user should be able to focus by clicking on the overlaying prompt.</p>

<p>The content of the textbox is tied to the newComment observable. Per the valueUpdate binding, it is updated after a key press.  Additionally, the propertychange and input parameters allow it to be updated when the user copies and pastes with the mouse or keyboard.</p>

<p>To animate the textbox, I use a custom binding which is also wired to the isEditing observable. The animation should be performed only when the textbox is empty or contains only white space. When the textbox has focus, it&rsquo;s expanded.  When it loses focus, it&rsquo;s collapsed.</p>

<p>The button is shown when the textbox has focus. Additionally it&rsquo;s only enabled when the user enters non-white space text. Clicking on the button simply adds adds the new comment to the comments observable array and clears the textbox. The beauty is that KnockoutJS automatically updates the UI to reflect the change.</p>

As advertised, the boot up and application start times are dramatically reduced.  The SSD is everything I had hoped for. Well, almost.  There has been a persistent and quite annoying issue.  At random intervals, the computer would be come unresponsive.  I could move the mouse or type on the keyboard, but nothing woud happen.  When I hovered over the menu bar, I got the spinning &ldquo;beachball&rdquo;.  The lag would last anywhere from 5-10 seconds.  Then all of a sudden all the actions I had performed in the interim would be executed in rapid succession, as if the computer had been jerked awake.  This was most noticeable during a streaming video, which would pause when one of these episodes hit.  The problem made the computer borderline unusable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that a firmware update for the Vertex 3 appeared to solve this problem.  I had firmware version 2.15, while the most current version was 2.25.   To upgrade the firmware, I followed the instructions for using the OCZ Bootable Toolbox on the OCZ forum. I had to use the <a href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?105168-NEW!!-OCZ-Bootable-Toolbox-PC-Edition-%28REBUILD%29">PC instructions</a>, since the Mac instructions are not applicable to my pre-2009 MacBook.  For me, the steps were to install the custom ISO disk image on a USB drive, then boot the PC from the USB drive.  The Vertex 3 had to be connected to an internal SATA port, as the OCZ Toolbox was not able to detect it if mounted in a USB enclosure.  This required me to open up the PC, a minor inconvenience.  The PC should also have an Internet connection. Overall, the process was painless and took under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The MacBook has been humming along so far without a hiccup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since 1999 I&rsquo;ve helped run a pickup hockey group at the Skating Club of Boston.  We&rsquo;re really not crazy about the rink there.  The ice is intended for figure skaters so it&rsquo;s soft and thus slow and quick to become choppy.  There is no glass above the boards so if you shoot high enough you&rsquo;d have to go fish for the puck under the stands. And since figure skaters generally stay in the middle of the ice, the edges are neglected and not well maintained; this is a problem if you try to &ldquo;wrap the puck around the board&rdquo;. Nevertheless, the location is great and we got to know the rink manager there quite well.  He gives us extra ice time and at the end of the year we try to return the favor by collecting to give him a nice X-mas check.</p>

<p>Our group started off as a bunch of friends who played intramural hockey at MIT together.  Over the years, people have come and gone, but I&rsquo;m the only constant. Since I still put the roster together every week, year round, I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a bit about the people who have played with us. I guess I could say I&rsquo;m a sort of unofficial historian.  Because of our academic origin, we&rsquo;ve always had a strong contingent of people with advanced degrees.  We&rsquo;ve had several PhDs, MDs and lawyers.  A few are current professors at local universities.  But probably thanks to hockey&rsquo;s grassroots appeal, I&rsquo;m amazed at the diversity we&rsquo;ve had.  We&rsquo;ve had cops, EMTs, firefighters,  architects, engineers, scientists, pilots, artists, designers, writers, tech entrepreneurs, a maître d’hôtel, a restauranteur, a couple of finance guys, a bunch of software guys.  Indie singers and DJs have leaped over the boards.  Which is somewhat surprising because we obviously have no marketing department.  It&rsquo;s probably just word of mouth or pure serendipity that some of these guys end up playing with us.  Over the years, there are some note-worthy names who have laced up the skates with us. So far as I remember here are some.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 1999 World Junior Ice Dancing champion</li>
<li>A Boston Police superintendent and head of the Bureau of Investigative Services</li>
<li>The platform director at Twitter</li>
<li>The founder of Colorkinetics (now Philips)</li>
<li>The former CEO of Akamai</li>
<li>The current general manager of the Red Sox. He&rsquo;s a quiet, good player who liked to be on defense. One of the complaints I remembered was that he didn&rsquo;t get off the ice very much.</li>
<li>The bassist for the punk band NOFX.  He just showed up at the rink with a hockey bag. The other guys told him to wait to check with me whether he could play (we don&rsquo;t want too many skaters).  We had room so he stayed.  Turned out he was in town for a concert and, being a hockey enthusiast and player, he brought his gears along. Apparently he does this on road trips.  Not all of us have heard of NOFX, but those who did were quite excited when they found out.  He was only an average player, but does possess first-class enthusiasm.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of my blogs are of the &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better write this down so I don&rsquo;t forget it&rdquo; variety.  This is one of them. This is intended primarily for future me, but it would be cool if anyone else finds it useful.</p>

<p>The equipment in question is an American Standard (Trane) Freedom 90 gas furnace that&rsquo;s about 7 years old. Recently, in fact right in the middle of a <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/nemo-historical-ranks-20130212">record-setting snowstorm</a>, it started blowing only cold air.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions in the manual to reset it (off-on-off-on in less than 30 seconds), to no avail. The burners would get ignited, then seemed to flame out.  The control board then tried to restart the process.  This would go on 5 times or so.  After that the blower fan would be going, but only ice-cold air was coming out.  The red light on the control board flashed twice in roughly 3-second intervals.  According to the manual, this indicated an &ldquo;External Lockout (retries or recycles exceeded)&rdquo; error.</p>

<p>Some online forums (google &ldquo;external lockout&rdquo;) implicated the flame sensor. Apparently it needs to be cleaned about once a year.  I&rsquo;ve never seen it much less touched it, so it&rsquo;s highly suspect.  Before working inside the furnace, it goes without saying that you must first turn down the thermostat and shut off power to the furnace. To get to it, remove the two panels on the front of the furnace starting with the bottom panel.</p>

<p>The burner unit is in an enclosed box at the top of the cabinet. There&rsquo;s a round viewport on the front bezel where you can observe the burners in action (provided they are running).</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/furnace-repair/DSC_5005.jpg" alt="DSC_5005" width="334" height="500" /></p>

<p>Remove the front door with an 8mm wrench. It hinges at the top and can be tricky to remove.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/furnace-repair/DSC_4999.jpg" alt="DSC_4999" width="500" height="500" /></p>

<p>Locate the flame sensor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/furnace-repair/DSC_4995.jpg" alt="DSC_4995" width="500" height="334" /></p>

<p>Remove it with a socket screwdriver.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/furnace-repair/DSC_4993.jpg" alt="DSC_4993" width="500" height="334" /></p>

<p>Thoroughly clean the sensor&rsquo;s rod and contact with sandpaper. I&rsquo;d use 150-grit as well as a finer sandpaper.</p>

<p>Replace the flame sensor. To test it out, you should replace just the burner door and the bottom panel of the cabinet; there&rsquo;s a door switch that prevents operation unless the panel is in place (or it is manually depressed). You can view the burners through the viewport.  Turn on the power and turn up the thermostat to call for heat.</p>

<p>In my case, the first attempt wasn&rsquo;t successful.  Before calling for service, I decided clean the flame sensor again even more thoroughly.  There was some rust on the contact that I made sure to remove with a fine-grit sandpaper. This must have done the trick.</p>

<p>Note to self: Clean the air filter while you&rsquo;re at it</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to replace the DVR that I get from Verizon Fios. Besides the monthly cost, it&rsquo;s an older unit that&rsquo;s slow and has the capacity for no more than a handful 3-hour hockey games recorded in HD. That is plainly unacceptable, especially during the Stanley Cup Playoffs. For the HD tuner, I decided to go with the SiliconDust HD Homerun Prime. For the DVR, I&rsquo;m going with a Mac Mini. I&rsquo;m a recent Mac convert, having used exclusively PCs until now. Even though I enjoy assembling PCs, I&rsquo;m at a point where I&rsquo;d like stuff to just work. Even more so, I&rsquo;m more and more a fan of the elegance and simplicity of OS X.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is like a work of art.  The model I have, however, has a drawback. While it is a level above the base model and comes with an Intel Core i7 processor, it has a rather sluggish 5400rpm hard drive. Since I plan on using it to watch live TV and record shows, I need more performance.</p>

<p>The server edition of the Mac Mini comes in the same case, but has 2 internal hard drives. It turns out that all Mac Minis (2012) have 2 hard drive slots.  For my Mac Mini, the second slot sits empty.  I want to add a Solid State Drive (SSD). The SSD will host OS X and the applications, while the other hard drive will host media. Getting to it in the cramped, tightly packed innards of the Mini seems like a daunting task.  Fortunately <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a> comes to the rescue by providing a prepackaged solution.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIYIMM11D2">OWC hard drive upgrade kit</a> for the Mini (2011-2012) comes with a flex cable to connect the hard drive, screws and tools. The cost for the kit is only a few dollars more than what you&rsquo;d have to spend to buy the flex cable separately.</p>

<p>I also got an SSD from OWC. OWC&rsquo;s in-house brand, Mercury Electra, is highly rated and assembled in the USA. I always look for something that&rsquo;s at least partially made in the USA whenever that&rsquo;s an option, even if it costs more.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4942.jpg" alt="DSC_4942" width="500" height="500" />
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4948.jpg" alt="DSC_4948" width="500" height="500" />
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4951.jpg" alt="DSC_4951" width="500" height="500" /></p>

<p>The online video instructions are quite excellent.  Even though the installation is rated as highly difficult, it&rsquo;s actually quite straight-forward if you&rsquo;ve ever assembled computers before.  All that&rsquo;s required are some nimble fingers to navigate the Mini&rsquo;s delicate insides.  Here&rsquo;s the Mini without its parts. It seems to have been carved out of a solid block of aluminum!</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4945.jpg" alt="DSC_4945" width="500" height="500" /></p>

<p>The SSD fits snugly into a plastic cage. It would sit below the stock hard drive.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4954.jpg" alt="DSC_4954" width="500" height="448" /></p>

<p>With the power supply bar slid into the right side of the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4955.jpg" alt="DSC_4955" width="500" height="394" /></p>

<p>This is the logic board assembly.  Isn&rsquo;t it adorable?</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4956.jpg" alt="DSC_4956" width="500" height="359" /></p>

<p>The logic board slides into place through an opening in the back.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4960.jpg" alt="DSC_4960" width="500" height="423" /></p>

<p>Now the old hard drive goes on top.  The two tabs to its lower left are the SATA connection tabs. The old hard drive has two small plugs that inserts into two slots on the front of the case (top of picture). The AirPort antenna grate in turn screws into the drive. You can&rsquo;t see the slots when inserting the drive back into the case. I didn&rsquo;t seat the drive properly in my first attempt and couldn&rsquo;t attach the antenna because the drive was misaligned.  Turns out the slots are slightly elevated.  I had to raise the hard drive slightly when inserting it.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4962.jpg" alt="DSC_4962" width="500" height="416" /></p>

<p>The AirPort antenna grate goes over the top.  The instructions plead with you not to overtighten the screws.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4964.jpg" alt="DSC_4964" width="500" height="444" /></p>

<p>Finally the fan and the DIMMs.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/mac-mini-ssd/DSC_4965.jpg" alt="DSC_4965" width="500" height="437" /></p>

<p>After connecting the Mini to an Ethernet switch and booting into Recovery mode (by holding down Command-R when booting), I selected Internet Recovery and let it install OS X Mountain Lion over the wire.  Minutes later, I was done.  Did I mention I love Macs?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When we traveled by car in Spain and Portugal in 2007, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that we managed to get around several cities using only a Michelin road atlas and a bunch of printouts of online maps. This time we&rsquo;re fully embracing 21st-century technology and bringing along a GPS device. To help save time, I like to enter destinations or waypoints ahead of time. On my Garmin nüvi 255W, it&rsquo;s a time-consuming process to enter waypoints (which Garmin calls Favorites). Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a way to create and edit waypoints on a PC, then later download them to the Garmin.</p>

<p>The Garmin stores waypoints in a GPX file (kudos to them for using standards-based format). This is a good thing, because there&rsquo;s an excellent application for editing a GPX file on a PC&mdash;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpxeditor">GPX Editor</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to connect the Garmin to the PC. After that you&rsquo;ll be able to browse the Garmin&rsquo;s memory card. Locate the current.gpx file under Drive\Garmin\GPX.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/garmin_folder.jpg" /></p>

<p>Copy current.gpx to the PC. You can also back up the file this way.</p>

<p>Open the copy of current.gpx in GPX Editor. Select the Google map tab, then select the plus icon to add a waypoint.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/gps_editor.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once the waypoint is added, it shows in the list on the left. You can edit it and give it a more meaningful name.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re done, just copy current.gpx back to the Garmin. Your new favorites should now show up.</p>

<p>This process works for my Garmin nüvi. I would suspect it would apply to other types of Garmin devices as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At home I use a MacBook to connect via VPN to the office. I&rsquo;d have access to the intranet but not shell access to my workstation. Since I usually work on the same project at home and at the office, I need to keep my work synchronized. One way to do that is with a Git remote branch.</p>

<p>At the office, I&rsquo;d create a local branch for the story I&rsquo;d like to work on:</p>

<pre>
git checkout master
git branch story_1
git checkout story_1
</pre>


<p>The last 2 steps can be replaced with the shortcut:</p>

<pre>
git checkout -b story_1
</pre>


<p>In the local branch, create a remote branch with the same name:</p>

<pre>
git push origin story_1
</pre>


<p>Alternatively, I could specify a different name for the remote branch:</p>

<pre>
git push origin story_1:cool_feature_1
</pre>


<p>To set up the local branch (i.e., the tracking branch) to track changes in the remote branch:</p>

<pre>
git checkout story_1
git branch -u origin/story_1
</pre>


<p>Alternatively, I could use a more verbose syntax:</p>

<pre>
git branch --set-upstream story_1 origin/story_1
</pre>


<p>If there&rsquo;s an existing remote branch and I want to create a new tracking branch with the same name:</p>

<pre>
git checkout --track origin/story_1
</pre>


<p>Inside a tracking branch, Git knows which server and branch to push to and pull from, so I can simply do <code>git pull</code> instead of <code>git pull origin story_1</code>.<sup>&dagger;</sup></p>

<p>Now that the remote branch is setup, I can create a tracking branch on the laptop as above.</p>

<p>Helpful references: <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches</a></p>

<hr>


<p><sup>&dagger;</sup> The behavior of &ldquo;git push&rdquo; actually depends on the push.default setting in .gitconfig and whether the tracking branch has the same name as the remote branch. The git-config man page gives the following information on push.default:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>push.default</b> Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is given on the command line, no refspec is configured in the remote, and no refspec is implied by any of the options given on the command line. Possible values are:</p>

<p>nothing &ndash; do not push anything.</p>

<p>matching &ndash; push all branches having the same name in both ends. This is for those who prepare all the branches into a publishable shape and then push them out with a single command. It is not appropriate for pushing into a repository shared by multiple users, since locally stalled branches will attempt a non-fast forward push if other users updated the branch. This is currently the default, but Git 2.0 will change the default to simple.</p>

<p>upstream &ndash; push the current branch to its upstream branch. With this, git push will update the same remote ref as the one which is merged by git pull, making push and pull symmetrical. See &ldquo;branch.<name>.merge&rdquo; for how to configure the upstream branch.</p>

<p>simple &ndash; like upstream, but refuses to push if the upstream branch&rsquo;s name is different from the local one. This is the safest option and is well-suited for beginners. It will become the default in Git 2.0.</p>

<p>current &ndash; push the current branch to a branch of the same name.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the tracking branch has the same name as the remote branch, <code>git push</code> will suffice.  If it has a different name and push.default is, for example, &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d have to specify the refspec: <code>git push origin HEAD:story_1</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We use <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> as our continuous integration server (although we&rsquo;re thinking about moving to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, but that&rsquo;s a different story). This post describes how we set up Hudson to work with Git and MSBuild on a Windows server.</p>

<h1>Pre-requisites</h1>

<p>We use the following software. The listed versions are the latest as of the time of writing, but other combinations should work.</p>

<ul>
<li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 7</li>
<li>Apache Tomcat 7.0</li>
<li>Hudson 2.2.1</li>
</ul>


<h1>Apache Tomcat</h1>

<p>Download and install the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi">Tomcat 7.0 Windows Service Installer</a>. In our case, the server already runs IIS on port 80, so we install Tomcat on a different port.  Remember this port as you will need it to access the Manager and Hudson.</p>

<p>Since Hudson will need to perform tasks that require access to more than one servers, such as deploying to a network share, we create a domain account which would be granted the necessary permissions wherever applicable. Configure Tomcat to run under the domain account as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the Start menu, run Configure Tomcat as Admin. Alternatively, you could open the Services console (shortcut: run Service.msc as Admin) and select Properties for the Apache Tomcat 7.0 service.</li>
<li>Under the Log On tab, enter the credentials for the domain account
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/tomcat7user.png" width="416" height="396" /></li>
<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
</ul>


<p>You can restart Tomcat by running the command prompt as Admin then type <code>net start tomcat7</code> to start or <code>net stop tomcat7</code> to stop the service.</p>

<p>Grant Read/Execute permission to the Tomcat account for the web application folders (e.g., webapps\manager, webapps\root) and Full Control for temp folder.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Manager is not accessible out of security consideration. You&rsquo;d have to specify the user who&rsquo;s allowed to access the page:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open c:\program files (x86)\Tomcat 7.0\conf\tomcat-users.xml</li>
<li>Enter the credentials for the user and specify the role as &ldquo;manager-gui&rdquo; with the following:
<code>&lt;user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui"/&gt;</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You can access the Manager at <a href="http://server:port/manager/html.">http://server:port/manager/html.</a></p>

<h1>Hudson</h1>

<h2>Install Hudson</h2>

<p><a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Download</a> the latest production .war.</p>

<p>To deploy Hudson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy .war to the Tomcat webapps folder. The name of the .war will be part of Hudson&rsquo;s URL, so rename hudson-2.1.2.war to hudson.war to shorten the URL. If Hudson is the only app, you can also rename the .war root.war to be able to access Hudson at the root URL.</li>
<li>Grant the Tomcat account full control to the webapps folder. This is because Tomcat needs to unpack the .war into a folder. After it&rsquo;s deployed, you can reset the permissions for the Tomcat account back to Read &amp; Execute.</li>
<li>Restart the Tomcat service if necessary.</li>
</ul>


<p>To upgrade Hudson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop the Tomcat service</li>
<li>Remove the old Hudson .war and folder from the webapps folder</li>
<li>Following the procedure to deploy Hudson</li>
<li>Your jobs should be saved to the .hudson folder in the user&rsquo;s home directory by default (e.g., c:\Users\TomcatAccount.hudson on Windows). They should be there when you start Hudson.</li>
</ul>


<p>To restart Hudson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browse to Tomcat Manager</li>
<li>Select Reload for the /hudson application</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve named the .war hudson.war, you can access Hudson at <a href="http://server:port/hudson.">http://server:port/hudson.</a></p>

<h2>Set up Git</h2>

<p>Hudson needs to locate the SSH RSA key files (in the .ssh folder) to use with Git. In order to do so, you need to specify the %HOME% environment variable, if it&rsquo;s not set.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s convenient to do so in Hudson:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the Hudson dashboard, select Manage Hudson</li>
<li>Select Configure System</li>
<li>Under the Global properties section, add the HOME environment variable and set it to the home directory of the Tomcat account where the .ssh folder is located.

</ul>


<h2>Set up MSBuild</h2>

<p>MSBuild is the Visual Studio build system. To install the MSBuild plugin, which allows you to access MSBuild:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the Hudson dashboard, select Manage Hudson</li>
<li>Select Manage Plugins</li>
<li>In the Available tab, check MSBuild and select Install</li>
</ul>


<p>To configure the MSBuild plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the Hudson dashboard, select Manage Hudson</li>
<li>Select Configure System</li>
<li>Under the MSBuild section, provide the path to the MSBuild executable similar to below.

</ul>


<h2>E-mail notification</h2>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/email.png" /></p>

<h2>Create a Hudson job</h2>

<p>Creating a job in Hudson is pretty straight forward, with just a form to fill out and no XML to fiddle with.</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/create.png" /></p>

<h3>Workspace</h3>

<p>The custom workspace is the location where you source code will go after being pulled from version control.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/workspace.png" /></p>

<h3>Source Code Management</h3>

<p>The URL of a Git repository is of the form gitaccount@server:gitrepository.git.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/git.png" /></p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This can be a multi-step process. You can have as many step as necessary. To add a build step, select an option from the Add build step dropdown.</p>

<p>In our case, we want to allow the user to select a particular Git tag to build. The list of tags is specified as Choice parameter. The selected value will be stored in an environment variable of the same name, $TAG.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/git-tag-param.png" /></p>

<p>To pull down the tag, we execute a series of step to ensure all tags are pulled down, then checkout the selected tag.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/git-tag-checkout.png" /></p>

<p>The final step uses MSBuild to run our build script.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/build.png" /></p>

<h3>Post-build</h3>

<p>The Chuck Norris plugin gives us a thumbs up for a successful build.  If the build fails, well let&rsquo;s just say you don&rsquo;t want to make Chuck angry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/post-build.png" /></p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><strong>FATAL: One of setGitDir or setWorkTree must be called</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try using a different workspace directory for each project</li>
<li>Try deleting workspace directory</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>HTTP Status 500 &ndash; java.lang.IllegalStateException: No output folder</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Grant permission to the Tomcat account for the app you&rsquo;re accessing (e.g., webapps\root)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looper, starring Bruce Willis and that awkward kid in Third Rock from the Sun, is a terrific movie with extraordinary storytelling, tightly woven narrative and great acting. I really enjoy it very much, despite some misgivings about its remorseless violence and relentlessly depressing depiction of the future. However, since I&rsquo;ve been asked if I can poke any hole in it, I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself as a task to find a chink or two in the movie&rsquo;s formidable armor, much in the same spirit as <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2012/06/11/whats-wrong-with-prometheus-a-partial-list">this critique</a>. There are probably a few holes in my own armor, as I&rsquo;ve only sat through the movie once and may miss details here and there. Needless to say, this is going to contain <strong>massive spoilers</strong>. I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty much going to give whole the movie away. So if you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie and would like to at some point, you will not want to read further. With that disclaimer out of the way, here goes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and others like him are Loopers, hired killers who execute prisoners sent from the future by an criminal syndicate via a time machine. The Looper waits at a certain location, typically in the middle of a field or in an abandoned courtyard. At the appointed time, the victim appears in front of them, tied and hooded. He pulls the trigger, removes the payment in the form of silver bars taped to the back of the victim, and disposes of the body in a furnace. Things are done this way, we&rsquo;re told, because in the future, it&rsquo;s very difficult to make people disappear without a trace. My question is, the criminals could operate a time machine but couldn&rsquo;t find a way to operate an incinerator?</li>
<li>The criminals go through the trouble of sending a man to the past to recruit and manage the Loopers and deal with things that could go wrong (which does). They risk polluting the time line if the victims end up escaping (they do). This seems like a needlessly complex scheme fraught with risk. Couldn&rsquo;t they just send the victim back 10,000 years or so where he would have perished without so much as a ding on the timeline. Okay, so maybe the time machine has a limited range and only works for the last 30 years or so. Couldn&rsquo;t they have set one up in the middle of a lake or just off shore? Make sure the victim is weighed down and he would just disappear beneath the waves.</li>
<li>The Looper is given the time on a piece of paper and the victim appears exactly at the appointed time. Nevermind the fact that they have to synchronize their watches over, oh, 30 years or so, how do they send a message from the future to set the time?</li>
<li>While future-Joe (Bruce Willis) followed present-Joe back to his apartment, he walked across an open garage and shot a thug sitting inside a car. Given that present-Joe is only armed with a blunderbuss&mdash;which he keeps on him&mdash;when future-Joe steals his truck, where does future-Joe get a gun?</li>
<li>For being professional killers, the thugs are horrendous shots. The one on top of the balcony at present-Joe&rsquo;s apartment keeps missing future-Joe who is only 30&mdash;40 feet away. Near the end, Kid Blue with his peashooter, again keeps missing present-Joe by a mile (though he was riding a hoverbike which makes aiming difficult).</li>
<li>Future-Seth ends up escaping. Under interrogation, present-Joe gives away present-Seth, who is captured. While future-Seth is running away, his fingers and leg begin to disappear and a tattoo appears on his forearm with an address. Mutilated, he barely makes it to the address, whereupon he is promptly shot. Apparently the bad guys mutilate present-Seth to directly affect future-Seth. This is a terrific setup for what would happen later in the movie. Nevertheless, since the goal is to get rid of the Seths, couldn&rsquo;t they just have killed present-Seth?</li>
<li>Loopers are dismissed with a final payment of gold bars. They know that in 30 years they would be captured and sent back to be executed, thus closing the loop. With the knowledge and the means, future-Joe does nothing to avoid this fate?</li>
<li>The in the &ldquo;flash forward&rdquo;, Joe goes to China. As the year goes by, he gets older. All of a sudden, he turns from Joseph Gordon-Levitt who has shoulder-length black hair into Bruce Willis who is 30 years older and almost completely bald.</li>
<li>The entire diner empties out without neither present- or future-Joe, who sit in the middle of it, noticing.</li>
<li>At the diner shootout, present-Joe joins the thugs in shooting at future-Joe. The thugs completely ignore present-Joe without realizing that with him they have immediate and lethal leverage over the other.</li>
<li>Kid Blue, on the tracks of future-Joe, goes to a guy who shows him a video feed of future-Joe approaching and peeking into the window of the prostitute&rsquo;s apartment. It seems like an extraordinary coincidence that he finds the right guy who has access to the right camera at the right location in a huge metropolis.</li>
<li>Most of the cars have tubes or pipes running around the rear, presumably into the fuel door. What is the purpose of the pipes? If they carry some sort of fuel, as is the most likely explanation, why leave them exposed in the back vulnerable to a rear-end collision or mischief.</li>
</ul>


<p>In all fairness, this is a very well-written and -executed movie. These are minor nitpicks and by no means should detract from your enjoyment of it.</p>

<time datetime="2012-09-16T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to upgrade a couple of PCs by replacing the motherboard (by the way, when buying PC components, if there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://microcenter.com/">Microcenter</a> store nearby, try it first; at the time of this writing their $50 bundle discount for a motherboard-CPU combo cannot be beat, even by much-loved online enthusiast stores).  Afterwards, I found that Windows 7 wouldn&rsquo;t boot.</p>

<p>In my prior experience, Windows would automatically detect the new motherboard and reconfigure itself accordingly.  However, in those cases, I&rsquo;d always replaced an AMD motherboard with the same.  This time I finally succumbed to Intel&rsquo;s growing CPU superiority and swapped an AMD motherboard for an Intel one. Windows would load drivers, crash, then reboot.  Apparently Windows wasn&rsquo;t able to load the drivers to work with the new motherboard. I ran Startup Repair once without success.  After I ran it the second time, Windows complained that &ldquo;Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically&rdquo;.  I was resigned to reinstalling Windows from scratch.  This isn&rsquo;t actually a horrible thing, since all my data are on a separate partition, but it would mean I&rsquo;d have to reinstall and configure apps all over again.</p>

<p>Luckily I found <a href="http://www.msigeek.com/2661/add-or-remove-a-driver-from-a-wim-image-using-dism">a post</a> describing how to use the DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) command-line tool.  This tool, intended for sysadmin use, allows you to load drivers into an existing Windows image or installation.  Our goal is to pre-load the necessary drivers to hopefully allow Windows to run on the new motherboard.  Here are the steps that worked for me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download drivers for the new motherboard.  I&rsquo;m using a USB flash drive as a boot/recovery drive so I copied them there, but you could use separate USB flash drive or even a DVD-R. You need the chipset and SATA drivers.  You can ignore the audio, LAN, video, etc. drivers as they are not necessary for Windows to load and can be left till later. Driver packaging depends on the manufacturer.  In my case, for my <a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3726#dl">Gigabyte motherboard</a> the chipset drivers are bundled in a single archive, while for the <a href="http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/?cat=Download&amp;os=Win7">Asrock motherboard</a>, they&rsquo;re all in separate files. Extract the files (some executables can be extracted) and copy only the appropriate folder for your flavor of Windows. The folder should contain an .INF file and .DLL or .SYS files.</li>
<li>Boot from your Windows install/recovery DVD or USB flash drive and select Repair</li>
<li>Select Advanced Options</li>
<li>Choose the Command Prompt option to get the command line</li>
<li>Now determine the drive where Windows is installed. This may not be where you think it is if the drives are remapped, say when you boot from a USB flash drive. The quickest way is just to list the files on drives C:, D:, E:, etc. and figure out which is which.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s say Windows is installed under C: and the drivers are under D:\mydrivers, use DISM follows:</li>
</ol>


<pre>
dism /image:C: /add-driver /driver:D:\mydrivers /recurse
</pre>


<p>The <code>/recurse</code> option conveniently lets DISM  install all drivers found under the specified folder.
1. Reboot. If Windows successfully boots, congratulations! The next step would be to configure the Ethernet adapter so you can install the rest of the drivers.</p>
