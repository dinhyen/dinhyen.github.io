  <div class="entry-content"><p>Breakfast brought us on another trip to Denny&rsquo;s.  You must think we love it.  In reality, the hotel was right next to the very busy Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway.  The only other place within reasonable walking distance would have been Subway&rsquo;s.  We had a free breakfast voucher, so Denny&rsquo;s it was.</p>

<p>We managed to get some local currency from the ATM.  Strangely, it also dispensed USD.  We had thought that it allowed you to specify the amount in USD, not actually giving you USD.  We found out the hard way, but on the other hand we were all set for cab fare when we get back.  I had in my hands a wad of 200000 colonnes.  Note to self, next time bring a bigger wallet.  Even with the ATM fee and the bank fee, the rate still turned out to be better than what we could have gotten from the exchange kiosk.</p>

<p>Having eaten our fill of oatmeal at Denny&rsquo;s, we couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out of town.  Next stop was Volcán Poás, one in a chain of volcanoes running along the country&rsquo;s mountainous spine.  The road was in decent condition, but winding.  Of course, we found ourselves stuck behind a big truck but were unable to pass because we couldn&rsquo;t see past the next bend in the road. Once we entered the national park, the road suddenly became very smooth.  They should put up a sign, &ldquo;Your entrance fee at work&rdquo;.   The restrooms were nice, but this was the norm practically everywhere we went in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>We had expected more strenuous hiking, but the way to the volcano was a gently sloped paved path lined with plants bearing gigantic leaves, appropriated nicknamed &ldquo;Poor man&rsquo;s umbrellas&rdquo;.  The volcano itself is basically a big, smoking crater.  It was strange seeing something resembling the lunar surface amid a lush tropical landscape.  Having seen Mauna Kea, Haleakala, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Lassen Peak and Crater Lake, I wasn&rsquo;t overwhelmed, but it was nice nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-2/DSC_0116.jpg" />

<p>On the way down, we took a steep but well-maintained trail to another crater lake, one that is more peaceful and not quite so steamy.  The trail was alive with the sounds of birds. In fact, according to the guidebook, it is teeming with no fewer than 26 species of hummingbirds.  Unfortunately from our vantage point, we saw only the few birds that made it down to about 5-10 feel above ground, including some that actually hopped along on the ground.</p>

<p>We were duly famished after the long hike. My last experience told me that the best place to sample some regional cuisine was the &ldquo;soda&rdquo;, which is something of a small eatery.  It&rsquo;s the Costa Rican version of a fast-food place, although there are bona fide fast-food joints (ahem, Denny&rsquo;s) in big towns and even a local flavor of KFC, Pollo Rey, whose mascot is a dead ringer for Foghorn Leghorn.  We got some delicious home-cooked food, drinks, and coffee for around $16.  Meanwhile, it started raining like a moonsoon and didn&rsquo;t let up for about 45 minutes.  This, I assure you, was typical.</p>

<p>Next destination was down the a cratered, half-paved road.  Believe me, any paving was better than no paving at all.  La Paz Waterfalls Garden seemed like a tourist trap, and the entrance price was steep at $35/person.  We pulled the trigger and was not disappointed.  You could spend hours in there (or, I should say, I could).  No need to climb trees to see birds, they were all there in a gigantic enclosure.  We started off with a regal-looking hawk, a menacing caracara and a turkey-like bird.  Then I wandered into the toucan cage.  I spent so much time in there even the toucans got annoyed and started making strafing runs at my head.  Other stars included butterflies, monkeys, a pair of sloths, ocelots and a couple of jaguars.  Then I caught glimpse of flittering, iridescent shapes.  Hummingbirds!  Who knew that after slogging through a 2-mile hike to see exactly 1 hummingbird, there they were, dozens of them, buzzing around the red feeders. Unfortunately, it was too dark to get good photos of them in the air.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-2/DSC_0385.jpg" />

<p>The biggest attractions were still to come.  Not one, not two, but three majestic waterfalls occur in quick succession.  The trail takes you close to the front of, and behind, the waterfalls.</p>

<p>Since it was getting dark and we still had to get to the Arenal area, we reluctantly left the park.  In hindsight, we should have continued on the road past La Paz, from which we could have seen the last and lowest falls.  But the GPS, in its brilliance, took us back down close to Highway 1 then back up again.  However, this way, we got quick glimpses of Grecia (the &ldquo;cleanest&rdquo; town in Latin America) and the famous topiary garden of Zarcero.  We also got stuck behind trucks, pedestrians, bikers, a cat, and some cows.  And the torrential rain returned throughout the drive.  Even the fastest windshield wiper setting wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough.  If I were to start a business in Costa Rica, it would not be a car wash.  Maybe something like a suspension and tire shop.</p>

<p>The estimable GPS put us at a warehouse.  Clearly not the delightful and luxurious resort we were promised.  We tried, in succession: using the payphone, stopping by another hotel to ask direction and chatting up the gas station attendant in broken Spanish.  Only the last one worked, and he pointed us in the direction of Tilajari Resort.  It was on an entirely different road, Garmin.  The rest is history. Salvation came in the form of dinner and a shower.  This was the second time in two nights we arrived close to 22:00.  Fortunately, Denny&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t yet expanded to this area.  Dinner was beyond delicious. Did I mention the beef in Costa Rica are all free-range?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came back from a second visit to Costa Rica, the first being 2 years ago.  This trip was quite spontaneous, after plans to catch a friend during her last semester in Venice fell through.</p>

<p>After not being quite prepared for the torrential tropical downpours or having a decent camera last time, I resolved that things would be different this time.  Checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>guide book (2008 edition),</li>
<li>Spanish phrasebook (unfortunately meant for Spain/Portugal as I lent someone the Costa Rica edition),</li>
<li>camera + telephoto lens + tripod  for waterfalls shots,</li>
<li>Bose noise-canceling headphone,</li>
<li>book club read (Blue Highway by William Least Heat-Moon),</li>
<li>pair of binoculars,</li>
<li>bug repellent,</li>
<li>waterproof jacket, hiking boots, quick-drying pants and shirts, and</li>
<li>ATM card (I had already called ahead to notify the bank that I would be using my credit and debit card abroad).</li>
</ul>


<p>First stopover was the cavernous Hartfsfield-Jackson International airport in Atlanta. Lots of servicemen abound.  After a hasty bite of so-so airport food, we were on our way to CR.  Flight consisted  mostly of gringos.  Judging from their footwear, some people must have planned to stay on the beach or in the hotel for the entire duration of the trip. I guess we wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing them on the trails any time soon.  Not a bad thing, too many people would scare away the local fauna.</p>

<p>After about 4 hours, we approached San Jose around 20:00 local time.  The ground below was mostly pitch-black punctuated by isolated dots of light.  Sometimes the lights were strung together like a string of pearls.  Then the disorderly jumble of lights that was San Jose came into view.  The city is quite large, but doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere near the same kind of glow as, say, Las Vegas.</p>

<p>After custom, we stepped into the mad scene outside the airport arrival gate.  We were accosted by no less than 8 cab drivers, speaking very good English. It was the first, and only time, we had to use &ldquo;No, gracias&rdquo; more than once.  At no time, however, did we feel that we were being harassed.  One guy, upon being turned down, offered a grin and a &ldquo;welcome to Costa Rica&rdquo;.  My pleasant impression from last time of the Ticos and Ticas remained intact.  Shortly afterwards we spotted our rental car contact holding a sign with our name on one side and &ldquo;Cooper&rdquo; on the other.  &#8221;Cooper&#8221; was nowhere to be seen, so after 10 minutes we were on our way to the Adobe Rental Car office about 5 minutes away.</p>

<p>Our ride was a compact Suzuki SUV, <em>everything</em> manual!  I hadn&rsquo;t seen once of those since, um, the last time I drove my sister&rsquo;s car.  The tread on the tires was all worn down; this came as no great surprise given what I knew of the Costa Rican roads on which we were about to embark.  About 15 minutes later an older couple arrived&mdash;it was our friends the Coopers!</p>

<p>First accommodation was Best Western.  On the way there we saw an enormous warehouse with the sign &ldquo;Lizano&rdquo;.  I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but it was the beginning of my love affair with the green stuff.</p>

<p>Everything apparently was closed around 22:00 when we arrived.  The only option? Denny&rsquo;s!  I hadn&rsquo;t even been to one in the US.  Kate said that the menu, decoration, uniform, music, and even the table mat were identical to those at all the other Denny&rsquo;s.  Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful? The main courses tasted just about what I expected, but the fresh fruit juices were a huge redemption in my eyes.  Also a bonus, they accepted dollars, which was good news because we didn&rsquo;t have the chance to stop by an ATM.</p>

<p>Needless to say, there are no pictures.  If you&rsquo;re wondering what it looks like, feel free to drop by your local Denny&rsquo;s!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago I took a software engineering class.  For the term project we divided up into teams and worked on a project of our own choosing from beginning to end.  Ours was an e-commerce application, the source code for which still resides on Google Code.</p>

<p>We were the Fantastic Five because, you&rsquo;d never guess it, there were 5 of us. I created the logo for the project.  For the &ldquo;super-hero&rdquo; effect, it has 2 stylized F&rsquo;s, made to look like wings flanking a shield.  I drew the shape in Illustrator and applied a chrome effect to it in Photoshop.  This is the original.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The task of selecting a name for this blog site was reduced to finding a number, since all the sensible permutations involving my first and last name have already been claimed.  The number 73 comes to mind.  As Sheldon pontificated in Big Bang Theory (season 4, episode 10), 73 is the &ldquo;best number&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s the 21st prime number, whose mirror is 37, which is the 12th prime number, whose mirror is 21, which is the product of 7 and 3.  Nice, but obscure. And people would probably assume, not without good reason, that it stands for something as prosaic as my birth year.  So 99 it is, a number meaningful to any hockey fan, and one that&rsquo;s on the back of all of the handful of jerseys I own.</p>

<p>Since this is my first post, it should have something interesting or at least Star Wars-related.  I think we can all agree that nothing beats a lightsaber duel.  I had this photo of our re-enactment of the Darth Maul,  Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan clash.  Before you snigger, only the idea of the Jedi fight was cool while the rest of Episode 1 was an abject failure.  In any case, the authenticity of this climactic scene was somewhat undermined by the fact that we were wielding twigs instead of lightsabers.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a minor problem that a little tool known as Photoshop wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fix.  After all, didn&rsquo;t I try to learn Photoshop so I could do just this?</p>

<p>After more than a few tweaks, here&rsquo;s the result.  Unfortunately there was no easy fix for the un-Jedi like outfit or the goofy facial expressions.  But the important thing was that no one risked getting an arm severed or having a hole drilled in his mid-section in this enterprise.  And we could pick our very own lightsaber color, like purple.</p>

<p>For the record, Beracah was going down!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since being migrated to my own domain, yen99 is no more.   But its namesake lives on in hockey lore.</p>
