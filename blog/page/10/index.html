  <div class="entry-content"><p>At breakfast we ran into another Belgian couple, this time from Antwerp.  They were on a tour of Ontario and Québec.  They were quite excited about a free outdoor performance of the Cirque de Soleil.  Sophie, who made us breakfast, also told us about the Moulin de l&#8217;Images, which was some sort of projection. We&rsquo;d have to check both of them out.</p>

<p>We escaped from warm and muggy Boston to somewhat warm and muggy Québec. But having sat in the car for 7.5 hours yesterday, we were ready for a walk.  The walking route took us through the commercial thoroughfare of St. Roch.  On Blvd Charest, the highway underpass has some really interesting murals.  We&rsquo;d visit them again.  Vieux-Québec, the only walled town in North America, sits high on a cliff.  We climbed a long staircase up to the ramparts. There are many such staircases along the wall in addition to a few steep streets, providing foot access to the old town.  Inside we found a warren of narrow, winding lanes and alleys, typical of a walled city.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_1994" src="http://www.yentran.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_1994.jpg" />
<figcaption>Vieux-Québec street</figcaption></p>

<p>Québec was the site of a definitive battle between Britain and France during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War">Seven Years&#8217; War</a> (the French and Indian War to Americans).  By the end of the war the victorious British had conquered most of the territories of New France. There are many sites in and around the city related to the battle that took place in 1759.</p>

<p>First stop was the Notre-Dame de Québec cathedral.  It was razed by the British after they conquered the city following the siege of Québec and subsequently rebuilt.</p>

<p>The most striking structure in town is the Chateau Frontenac, a turn-of-the-century hotel built to resemble a castle.  It&rsquo;s ringed by the Dufferin Terrace, a boardwalk that overlooks the St. Lawrence river.  This wide walkway is tremendously popular with street performers, vendors and tourists.  Not surprisingly, it was already packed with more people continuing to pour in.  We decided to escape the crowds and take the La Promenade des Gouverneurs, a series of stairs that runs up the cliff from the terrace to the so-called Plain of Abraham.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_2048" src="http://www.yentran.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_2048-300x182.jpg" width="300" height="182" />
<figcaption>Painting in the Martello tower museum showing the landing of Wolfe&#39;s troops at L&#39;Anse-au-Foulon</figcaption></p>

<p>The plain is the site of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Quebec">Battle of Québec</a>.  In 1759, having unsuccessfully landed downriver at Montmorency Falls, British troops led by General James Wolfe made a daring landing here.  The invaders made their way up the cliffs and surprised the small garrison. The battle was joined when French forces led by Marquis de Montcalm arrived on the scene.  Both sides sustained roughly equal losses.  Both commanders, Wolfe and de Montcalm, died from wounds received during the battle.  After the battle, the French retreated, ceding Québec to the British.  Nowadays the scene of the bloody battle is a <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Champs-de-Bataille">park</a> with wide-open meadows interspersed with wooded areas. Numerous species of birds are known to frequent the areas.  Gentle footpaths through the woods provide respite from the sun.</p>

<p>Next stop was the Martello towers.  They were built by the British to guard against possible attacks by the Americans during the years leading to the War of 1812, though they never saw action.  There are 4 of them defending the heights.  The first Martello tower is a small museum ($5CAD to enter).  It consists of 3 level: powder room, living quarters and roof/cannon platform.  Over the years, the Martello towers have served in various capacities, including as a water tower and a home!  The museum isn&rsquo;t very remarkable except for an old photo showing the thickness of the wall facing would-be attackers.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_2083" src="http://www.yentran.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_2083.jpg" />
<figcaption>Le Cochon Dingue</figcaption></p>

<p>It was too hot to tour the Citadelle, so we headed back down to the Quartier Petit Champlain.  This ancient commercial district, nestled between the river and the foot of the cliff, is now a bustling tourist area.  Imagine Boston&rsquo;s Newbury Street packed into an area half the size.  There is a trompe-l&#8217;œil mural at the end of the street (as does Newbury Street).  We had lunch at Le Cochon Dingue (the Crazy Pig).</p>

<p>Next stop was the Musée de Amérique Française.   This place is quite interesting. The museum is on the grounds of a seminary, which it also shares with the Centre de la Francophonie des Amérique.  Maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising because Séminaire de Québec has been an important religious and social institution since the early days of the city. Fittingly, the chapel hosts not only the sarcophagus of Bishop de Laval, the first bishop of New France, but also secular events such as meetings and concerts.  The museum is very nicely done but small, like most things here. The first floor houses religious artifacts, the second the history of the Augustinian Sisters and the third artifacts from French immigrants across the Americas.  For me the most important thing was the air conditioning, which made the place perfect for a small nap.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_2177" src="http://www.yentran.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_21771-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" />
<figcaption>Mega-mural</figcaption></p>

<p>Our route became pretty desultory by this time.  We headed back to the Basse-Ville with its gigantic trompe-l&#8217;œil mural, to Place-Royal&mdash;site of the church of Notre-Dame des Victoires, to the waterfront, then up to the star-shaped Citadelle via the busy Rue St-Louis.  This road passes through one of the main entrances in the walls of the old city.  It was packed with restaurants and shops.  Traffic included horse-drawn carriages.</p>

<p>One side of the Citadelle is fenced so you can&rsquo;t come to the edge of the &ldquo;moat&rdquo;, which is perhaps a good thing. The other side is an an open-lawn where you can get a good view of the Chateau Frontenac and the river.  We ambled down to the old city wall and walked to Rue St-Jean, another main entry through the wall.  Through the ramparts of an old watch tower, we could see Rue St-Jean below, which was packed with pedestrians because it was closed to traffic.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_2301" src="http://www.yentran.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_2301.jpg" />
<figcaption>Cirque de Soleil performance</figcaption></p>

<p>After an excellent veal dinner at where else but Le Veau d&#8217;Or, we headed down to the vicinity of the old port for the Cirque de Soleil show, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Chemins_invisibles">Les Chemins Invisibles</a>. It took place inside a fenced off area below highway overpasses.  This was only 6-7 blocks from our B&amp;B, so we definitely lucked out on the location. The place was packed, though not as much as you&rsquo;d think for a free performance by the troupe.  There were some trapeze and acrobatic acts and some other acts accompanied by a pounding soundtrack.  I wasn&rsquo;t really a fan before and I wasn&rsquo;t gonna start now.  We headed off to the Vieux-Port to see the Moulin de l&#8217;Images. The Vieux-Port was practically next door.  Again staying near the center of the city paid off.  Turned out the spectacle was projected movie clips and images on the wall of a 20-story warehouse/ factory on the riverfront.  I though the images were annoyingly fuzzy until Kate pointed out it was 3-D.  Silly me!  3-D was useless without glasses, not to mention the content was meaningless to us without some context.  We called it a day, a productive one at that.  We were quite impressed that there were so many events that made such a attractive city even more appealing.</p>

<h1>Defensemen</h1>

<p><strong>#33 Zdeno Chara</strong> &ndash; Tallest man in hockey history and probably using the longest stick and wearing the largest skates as well.  With his monstrous wingspan he can easily cover his half of the ice.  Very nice guy off the ice, but a big (and tall) bogeyman on it.</p>

<p><strong>#44 Dennis Seidenberg</strong> &ndash; Rugged German-born defenseman.  Blocks a ton of shot.  Possesses outstanding balance and is very strong on his skates.  You do not want to get caught in the corner with him, chances are you won&rsquo;t be coming out.</p>

<p><strong>#55 Johnny Boychuk</strong> &ndash; Owns the best open-ice hit as well as hip check on the team. Best hip checker since a former Bruins also with initials JPB and from Edmonton&mdash;John Bucyk.  His booming slapshot is second only to Chara&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><strong>#21 Andy Ference</strong> &ndash; Another tenacious defenseman, small in stature but not in heart.  He will not back down against anybody. Best remembered in this playoffs for <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/extras/bruins_blog/2011/04/andrew_ference.html">flipping the finger to Canadiens fans</a> after scoring a goal in Game 4.  Also known as the opponent in Sidney Crosby&rsquo;s first fight.</p>

<p><strong>#54 Adam McQuaid</strong> &ndash; Quiet but tough defenseman from Prince Edward Island, a perfect Bruin.  More than capable with his fists.</p>

<p><strong>#12 Tomas Kaberle</strong> &ndash; Came over from Toronto in a mid-season trade as the much sought-after &ldquo;puck-moving defenseman&rdquo; meant to provide a boost to the Bruins&#8217; anemic power play.  Great puck-handler but not overly physical. Solid but not as spectacular as hoped.</p>

<h1>Forwards</h1>

<p><strong>#22 Shawn Thorton</strong> &ndash; Rugged and fearless fighter who sticks up for any teammate. Brings a ton of energy.  Hits anything that moves and can surprise opposing goalies with a bad-angle shot.  Tremendously popular with the Bs&#8217; fan base for toughness and blue-collar work ethics (no surprise because he did work in the factories before hockey). Also known for his <a href="http://shawnthorntonsays.tumblr.com">sense of humor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>#19 Tyler Seguin</strong> &ndash; The youngest Bruins.  Oodles of skills with some jaw-dropping moves.  Scored a couple of highlight-reel goals in the Tampa Bay series.  A Bruins star for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>#91 Marc Savard</strong> &ndash; The Bs&#8217; best play-making center, apt to making amazing passes that nobody expects.  Out since suffering a repeat concussion against Colorado but returned for the Stanley Cup parade.  Hopefully he&rsquo;ll make a comeback.</p>

<p><strong>#73 Michael Ryder</strong> &ndash; Probably the Bs&#8217; best sniper with his deadly toe-drag snap shot.  Streaky player during the regular season but always outstanding in the playoffs. He notched the OT goal against the Canadiens in Game 3.</p>

<p><strong>#28 Mark Recchi</strong> &ndash; He began his NHL career a few years before Seguin was born. He&rsquo;s at or near the top of the league in several statistical categories. With great hands for deflection and close shots, he made his living within a few feet of the crease while taking a ton of punishment in the process.  Even more valuable as a leader on the ice and in the dressing room with his unmatched experience.  Announced his retirement after the Bs won the Cup; there was no better way to leave.  I shook his hands when I saw him at the Prudential Center last Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>#49 Rich Peverley</strong> &ndash; Small but highly skilled player who was acquired from Atlanta in a mid-season trade.  Versatile&mdash;he&rsquo;s a natural center but can play either wing and can kill penalties.  He scored the a brilliant first goal against the Canucks in Game 4 which ignited the rout.</p>

<p><strong>#23 Chris Kelly</strong> &ndash; Another of the Bs&#8217; deep line-up of two-way centers.  Acquired mid-season from Ottawa.  Great defensive player with outstanding speed.  Scored <a href="http://thehubofhockey.net/2011/04/28/chris-kelly-has-been-a-pleasant-surprise">key goals</a> in the Canadiens series, without which the Bs wouldn&rsquo;t have made it past their toughest opponent in the 2011 playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>#20 Daniel Paille</strong> &ndash; The fastest Bruin.  He almost singlehandedly transformed their penalty kill when he arrived a few years ago. Not a great finisher but his quickness creates a lot of opportunities for himself and his teammates.</p>

<p><strong>#11 Gregory Campbell</strong> &ndash; A key pre-season acquisition from Florida and another unsung hero.  Well-known as the son of the NHL&rsquo;s former head disciplinarian, he&rsquo;s a solid anchor for the energetic fourth line, often the Bs&#8217; best line during the regular season and playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>#17 Milan Lucic</strong> &ndash; The fan favorite with his snarly demeanor and penchant for fighting, as evident from the number of &ldquo;Lucic Fight Club&rdquo; t-shirts and bumper stickers. Most fans remember being brought out of their seats by his famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjZbNtzsQFY">beat-down of then-Canadien Mike Komisarek</a>.  Very tough pugilist known for drawing blood from his opponents. Also capable of delivering a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWqgizAD4FA">devastating hit</a>.  He&rsquo;s toned down this season after discovering his scoring touch.</p>

<p><strong>#18 Nathan Horton</strong> &ndash; Speed, toughness and competitiveness in abundance.  Always smiling, a great addition to the dressing room since his acquisition from Florida along with Campbell.  Became playoffs hero after scoring 3 game-winning goals against Montréal and Tampa Bay,  2 of which in Game 7.  Also indirectly helped when the team rallied after he was knocked out of the playoffs by an Aaron Rome hit.</p>

<p><strong>#63 Brad Marchand</strong> &ndash; Rambunctious little guy who went from nobody to one of the best performers in the regular season and playoffs.  Very fast player who&rsquo;s extremely mobile in tight spaces.  Also shifty which lets him shake off defenders.  Not afraid to land a hit and capable of flattening much bigger players.  Will drop the gloves if challenged.  He&rsquo;s fast becoming a very popular Bruin, rightly so, judging by the amount of cheers for him during the parade.</p>

<p><strong>#37 Patrice Bergeron</strong> &ndash; One of the best defensive forwards in the game. Consistently the Bs&#8217; best player on most nights. Amazingly mature for someone who&rsquo;s only 25. Scored the first and third goal against the Canucks in Game 7, sending the Bs to the Cup.</p>

<p><strong>#46 David Krejčí</strong> &ndash; The top center after Savard was lost for the season.  Very shifty with subtle shoulder and head fakes which make defenders look foolish.  Excellent vision. Uncanny ability to find open spaces and thread a perfect pass to an open teammate. Time seems to slow when he has the puck.  When the Bs run around in their zone, they usually get out of trouble when the puck comes to Krejčí.</p>

<h1>Goalies</h1>

<p><strong>#40 Tuukka Rask</strong> &ndash; Very athletic young goalie.  Excellent positionally and seldom gets caught in a bad spot. His calm demeanor in net helps settle the team down.  A pillar of the team for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>#30 Tim Thomas</strong> &ndash; In many ways the opposite of Rask.  Relies heavily on reaction and athleticism to make saves.  Limitless desire to compete. Doesn&rsquo;t ever give up even if the situation appears hopeless.  Probably owns the most <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvAbr4cCBjQ">highlights</a> for a goalie. Unconventional but undeniably effective, to the tune of the record for regular season save percentage, two Vézinas, one Conn Smythe, and one Stanley Cup.</p>

<p>Other memorable former Bs  include Matt Hunwick, Blake Wheeler, Marco Sturm and Mark Stuart.  Their names won&rsquo;t be on the Cup but their contributions aren&rsquo;t forgotten.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts.  The former was a bit more adventurous.  We went on a hike on <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=27909">North Moat Mountain</a> and underestimated the terrain  (or overestimated our ability).  Even though we&rsquo;re decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.  We found ourselves still on the trail when darkness fell and ended up being rescued by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Service.   Thanks a bunch, guys.</p>

<p>Here are some photos from those trips.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every season in Boston has its own riveting appeal.  The fall is not only the most beautiful of seasons, but it also marks the start of the hockey season and, for non-hockey fans, the annual Head of the Charles Regatta.  In 2010, the Regatta took place on a chilly weekend in late October (this was Boston, after all).  For me, there was nothing better than to put on a warm jacket, hop on the bike for the half-hour ride to Harvard University, then snap away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>File this as another in the category of &ldquo;places I&rsquo;ve gone by hundreds of times while being clueless that it exists&rdquo;.  This is just steps away from historic Concord Center, which is popular with tourists and cyclists alike.  The Old North Bridge, site of the confrontation that led to &ldquo;the shot heard around the world&rdquo;, is about 5 minutes away, while Thoreau&rsquo;s Walden Pond is just down the road.  On a nice day, you&rsquo;d see a constant train of cyclists going around the rotary on their way to the north and west suburbs.   Or a long line of parked cars on the bridge, whose owners are floating somewhere on the Concord River in a canoe or kayak.</p>

<p>After the chaos and excitement that was the <a href="http://www.yentran.org/blog/?p=310">Bruins Stanley Cup parade</a>, we decided to stop here for some relaxation and hopefully catch a heron or two.  &#8221;We&rsquo;re going to see 7,&ldquo; Kate said, wishfully.  It turned out that we only saw 4 herons.  But the ubiquitous red-winged blackbirds abounded in these marshes (according to Tanya, they should technically be called red-<em>shouldered</em> blackbirds).  Not advertised were the billions of mosquitoes who swarmed and attacked us at every available opportunity.  I lost count of how many mosquitoes I swatted, it couldn&rsquo;t have been fewer than about 1500.  Unfortunately herons don&rsquo;t prey on mosquitoes.  My tree swallow and bat friends, where were you?  Next time, I will have to bring a head net.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Would you expect any less from a die-hard hockey fan?  So with a warning that this is going to be shamelessly biased, here goes.</p>

<ol>
<li>At the 2011 NHL All-Stars game, NY Islanders forward Michael Grabner  won the Fastest Skater competition with a time of 14.238 seconds. The track length is about 550 ft.  This translates to 38.6 ft or 12.9 yards/second.  For comparison, let&rsquo;s look at the fastest 40-yard dash for football players, who are speedsters in their own right.  To cover 40 yards, Grabner took 3.1 seconds. The current record for a 40-yard dash by a football player is 4.24 seconds, a full 36% more. Furthermore, Grabner didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of going in a straight line, but had to make tight turns as he raced around the rink.  And Grabner probably had enough gas to go another rink length or so with only a slight reduction in speed.</li>
<li>All of that insane foot speed in an enclosed rink leads to, you guess it, insane collisions.  Just googling something along the lines of &ldquo;top hockey hits&rdquo; should return some good samples.  A heavy, clean hit is an awesome sight to behold.</li>
<li>At the 2011 All-Star game, Bruins captain Zdeno Chara <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=551036">broke his own record</a> for the hardest slapshot in history with a blistering shot that registered 105.9 mph.  Tennis players routinely serve faster than that.  However, no one ever got hospitalized after getting hit with a tennis ball.  A hockey puck is made of vulcanized rubber.  When it becomes frozen during the game, it&rsquo;s bone-crushing hard. And yet&hellip;</li>
<li>Hockey players routinely throw their body in harm&rsquo;s way to block shots. They would gladly take a puck to the face if the Cup is on the line.  This is because&hellip;</li>
<li>Hockey players are the toughest in all of sports.  And it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the willingness to stand toe-to-toe with some lumberjack from Moose Factory, Ontario and take bare-knuckled haymakers to the face.  <em>Exhibit A</em>: Brendan Witt of the NY Islanders <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=301565">got hit by SUV</a>, swore a few times, played game at night.  <em>Exhibit B</em>:  Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning <a href="http://thebiglead.com/index.php/2011/05/27/steven-stamkos-takes-a-puck-to-the-face/">kissed puck with noggin</a>, came off ice gushing blood, put on somethingeld, returned to game. <em>Exhibit C</em>:  Martin St. Louis, also of the Lightning, <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Players+grin+bear/4829144/story.html">ate a stick in the mouth</a> which knocked out 2 teeth, took some painkillers, played on.  Toughness is an unwritten code.  You play, unless the injury hampers your effectiveness.  This is why it is anathema for a hockey player to be writhing around to get a call from the refs.</li>
<li>Hockey players play with razor blades on their feet and a deadly weapon in their hands.  Despite being relatively well-protected, they are susceptible to unusually nasty injuries.  Some are too gruesome for me to even contemplate. If you&rsquo;re curious, google injuries to Bryan Berard, René Bourque or Richard Zednik.</li>
<li>Hockey requires tremendous skill.  Before you can even play, you need to learn to skate. Not just forward and backward, but forward crossover (left and right), backward crossover  (left and right) and stopping (left and right, one- and two-footed).  You also need to learn puck-handling, passing (forehand and backhand) and shooting (wrist shot, snap shot, slapshot).  And then there&rsquo;s this business of taking and dishing out hits. These aren&rsquo;t exactly common skills that you pick up doing every day things.</li>
<li>How many time-outs are allowed per game?  Not 6, not 3 per half, not whenever you want to. One.  That&rsquo;s it. Use it wisely.</li>
<li>The final seconds of a close game are the most exciting moments of the game.  One team is forced to pull its goalie, leaving a gaping net, in a desperate attempt to get the tying goal.  Most of the time the offensive zone is a mad house of tumbling bodies, diving goalie, ricocheting puck and broken sticks. One lucky shot by the defending team and it would be all over. Are you listening, basketball?</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Shot_(film">funniest sports movie ever</a>) is about hockey</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, we visited the Chihuly exhibit at the MFA. Like most people, I strained to find familiar words to describe something unfamiliar (during those moments when my mind wasn&rsquo;t occupied with playing over and over the disastrous scenario of inadvertently knocking something down).  Here are some of the ones I came up with.  But sometimes, you just have to admit that there isn&rsquo;t a word.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been discovering more and more of the amazing gems that are the Audubon sanctuaries.  Recently I visited the <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php">Ipswich River sanctuary</a> and the <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Broadmoor/index.php">Broadmoor sanctuary</a>, both of which are amazing for the scenery and wildlife they contain.  Yet I&rsquo;m surprised to learn that there are sanctuaries much closer to home, some right around the corner.  The <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Habitat/index.php">Habitat sanctuary</a> is no more than 10 minutes from my place. I had biked or driven past this area before without knowing that it existed.  I would bet that it is also unknown to most of the thousands of commuters who ply busy Route 2 every day, just steps away from the sanctuary.</p>

<p>The Habitat is a quiet enclave, nestled between suburban streets, houses and even the football field of the nearby high school.  Yet it is typical of Audubon sanctuaries in that once you&rsquo;re inside, you&rsquo;re virtually cut off from the outside world, except for occasional glimpses of the obnoxiously bright houses.  Many things can be found here, including a pond with an island in the middle, birch stands, wide meadows, open glades, a boardwalk, even a greenhouse.  A walk here is a return to the tranquility that existed before they put a 6-lane highway through it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to write about the Audubon sanctuaries in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Boston&rsquo;s first Stanley Cup parade in 39 years was going to take place on Saturday, June 18, three days after the team celebrated on the ice in Vancouver. It was as definitive a &ldquo;clear your calendar&rdquo;-type event as it will ever be. On the morning of C-day, we got up early, loaded up with a hearty breakfast, filled the caffeine meter, and made sure we went to the bathroom before heading down to the T. Then we made the unfortunate newbie mistake of coming out at Park Street station. We found ourselves shoulder-to-shoulder with what seemed like half the population of Somerville. We tried to make headway for about 20 minutes, going the whole of 30 feet, before deciding that the effort would ultimately be futile. We stopped in our tracks, which didn&rsquo;t take much effort at all, and found a spot on the steps of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul. Despite the view being obstructed by a small kiosk and a tree, it was quite pleasant. Everyone was understandably less than thrilled about being packed together like sardines, but the mood was predictably upbeat, laced with an undercurrent of nervous energy that was almost palpable. After all, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a part of the <a href="http://www.nesn.com/2011/06/crowd-for-bruins-stanley-cup-parade-is-largest-ever-for-championship-celebration-in-boston.html">biggest celebration in Boston history</a>?</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;q=united+episcopal+church&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;sll=42.363269,-71.068454&amp;sspn=0.03098,0.042186&amp;st=115664277548083516147&amp;rq=1&amp;ev=zi&amp;split=1&amp;radius=1.29&amp;hq=united+episcopal+church&amp;hnear=&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=42.355928,-71.062606&amp;panoid=9zi0PLtD0_-Z6_cl6LOHUg&amp;cbp=13,131.06,,0,-5.68&amp;source=embed&amp;t=h&amp;ll=42.355928,-71.062606&amp;spn=0,0.036478&amp;z=14&amp;output=svembed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="240"></iframe>

<p>The crowd was fraught with anticipation. Someone yelled out, &ldquo;They just left the Gahden&rdquo;. Oohs and aahs went up several times, but they were false alarms. Finally we heard a distant cheer. It got louder as it came rolling down Tremont Street and became deafening as the first Duck Boat floated into view. One by one the boats passed in front of us. Chara and Thomas were near the front, raising their arms and giving the thumbs up. The adoring crowd returned the favor. Then inevitably someone&mdash;or perhaps many simultaneously&mdash;started the &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Bruins&rdquo; chant. The chant was immediately picked up by everyone else who was not already screaming at the top of their voice. The chant reached a crescendo, reverberating off the venerable facades that line Tremont Street. It was as exhilarating as it ever was in the Garden. Life is good as a Bruins fan today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zdeno Chara grabbed hold of the Cup, reverently brought it to his lips, then raised it above his head, repeating a ritual performed by all previous Cup-winning captains. The only difference was that it had not been done by someone wearing the spoked-B since Nixon was President.  The events of this night surely sent Bruins fans everywhere into a delirium.  For the entire time that the Bruins celebrated on the ice, I had a stupidly wide grin on my face.  I am quite sure I wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>

<p>When the playoffs started back in April, not many fans would have thought this outcome to be possible.   The Bruins certainly did not make things easy on themselves. They started the playoffs with two disheartening home losses to the Montréal Canadiens that had even the most optimistic fans staring into the abyss.  They had struggled mightily against the Canadiens during the regular season, dropping all road games against them, even though they came up with two huge wins at home.  Now they faced the prospect of having to win at the Bell Centre, an arena notoriously hard for opposing teams to play in.  But just when people counted them out, the team shone. They dug deep and silenced the raucous Bell Centre crowd with two wins of their own, one of which in overtime.  They eked out a win in Game 5 in double-overtime before losing a hard-fought Game 6 thanks to not one but two five-on-three power-play goals for the Canadiens. Game 7 was a nail-biter.  They scored two early goals, but the dangerous Canadiens evened the score. The teams traded goals in the 3rd period, with the Canadiens scoring on a now predictable late-game power play, sending the game to yet another overtime. This time, it was Nathan Horton&rsquo;s turn to be the hero.  With just 5 &frac12; minutes gone, he sent a blistering one-timer off a pass from Milan Lucic past Carey Price, putting the home crowd into a frenzy and propelling the Bruins past their their toughest test of this playoffs. Three overtime games, including Game 7&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t have gotten any tighter than this.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the Stanley Cup Finals.  Before the series began, the Canucks were the overwhelming favorite as the best team in the NHL.  Things got even bleaker as the Canucks took the first two games in thrilling fashion (or deflating if you&rsquo;re a Bruins fan).   Then just when you think things couldn&rsquo;t get any worse, early in Game 3 Bruins playoffs hero Horton was knocked senseless by a vicious hit  from Aaron Rome and had to be carried off the ice on a stretcher.  A lesser team would have been cowed and beaten. But true to the form of a champion, the Bruins rallied around their fallen teammate.  They humiliated the Canucks with an 8-1 victory in Game 3 and twice more at home, pushing the series to Game 7.  Despite the hype leading up to it, the climactic game  turned out not to be as tense as previous must-win games against the Canadiens and the Tampa Bay Lightning.  Canucks starter Roberto Luongo had been stellar in previous three home games but downright horrible in the three games played in Boston.  Sensing vulnerability, the Bruins pushed hard.  Near the end of a back-and-forth first period, Patrice Bergeron broke through with a brilliant goal&mdash;made possible by an excellent cycling effort from Brad Marchand&mdash;that Luongo only saw after the puck had already gone past him.  Marchand got the job done himself mid-way through the 2nd period with a wrap-around goal that Luongo failed to keep out of his net. Five minutes later, Bergeron put a nail in the coffin of the Canucks&#8217; much vaunted power-play with a short-handed goal.  Even with more than a period left in the game, by this time the Bruins were firmly in control. With Tim Thomas stopping everything the Canucks put on the Bruins&#8217; net, the game was merely a formality when Marchand punctuated the victory with an empty-net goal.</p>

<p>Before the series began, the Canucks forwards had been deemed too fast and too strong.  They scored exactly 8 goals over 7 games and their best stars were largely invisible.  The Canucks defense were deemed too mobile and too deep.  They looked like a beaten and battered bunch by the end.  The Canucks power-play was deemed the most potent in decades; it was a deadly weapon in their easy series victories over the Predators and Sharks. Against the Bruins it yielded just 2 goals but gave up 3 short-handed goals. Luongo was considered a more solid and reliable goalie than Tim Thomas given the latter&rsquo;s unconventional style.  Yet the Bruins shellacked him in Boston, putting 8 pucks past him in one game and forcing him to be pulled in the others, a feat unheard of in the Stanley Cup Finals.  All the while Thomas was matching or outplaying his counterpart in nearly every facet.</p>

<p>There are many things to be proud of this year&rsquo;s team.  Overcoming a 0-2 deficit, twice, to win a series. Beating their hated and most dangerous rival.  Sweeping the team that had dealt them such an ignominious end in the previous playoffs.  Scoring the fastest four goals in a Finals game to set the stage for an epic upset of the Cup favorite.  And finally, bringing home the Stanley Cup after a 39-year absence.</p>
