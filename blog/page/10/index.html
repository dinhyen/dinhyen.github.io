The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?) and their endless plotting and machinations. Perhaps because I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t care much for politics, I find most of the plot borderline dull. Even the climax seems rushed, being resolved in about 15 pages or so, and leaves many loose ends. Perhaps most annoyingly, the main characters go out and put themselves in danger needlessly and trivially; knowing that things would be tied together somehow in the end doesn&rsquo;t make it any less annoying. The emotional veins that make the previous volumes so endearing are conspicuously absent here; there are few sympathetic characters to latch on to, to exhort. The only thrills I had with this book have to do with Cara&rsquo;s adventures, few though they are. This volume is the weakest in the series thus far. I can only hope number 6 will be better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Faith_of_the_Fallen" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Faith_of_the_Fallen-201x300.jpg" width="201" height="300" />Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society. As such, while we follow Richard and Nicci&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventures&rdquo; in the Old World, perhaps it can&rsquo;t be help that the pace is plodding and the tone annoyingly didactic. Yes, the Order believes that man is inherently evil, yes, those with ability must help those without for the common good, yes, the Order brings equality to all; the point is made, but must it be repeated every chapter by every character? At times, the book reads like &ldquo;1984&rdquo; in the Middle Ages. And at times, the book stretches the limit of believability: that the Order is able to dominate a vast society with mind-numbing single-mindedness and unsophisticated fanaticism, that the great wizard and leader Richard would so easily give in to his fate even though he has faced much worse odds before, that in the end a work of art is able to convert the masses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not happy with the way some characters are handled, or not handled at all. Nothing is mentioned of the major Ander characters from Soul of the Fire, nor of Nathan; Ann appears at the beginning and resurfaced at the end, her role adding nothing to the story; nothing comes up of Ulicia and the other Sisters of the Dark; albeit they&rsquo;re minor characters, the way Harold and Cyrilla turned out are rather uncharacteristic. And, as he has done in the past, Goodkind terminate some important and sympathetic characters rather abruptly; it isn&rsquo;t disappointing that they disappear, but that in doing so they don&rsquo;t affect the plot at all. While, at long last, the vast D&#8217;Haran and Imperial Order armies clash, the description of the battles lack the scale, the fury, and the visceral excitement seen in the works of others like Robert Jordan. All of that said, Goodkind brought to life a remarkable character, Nicci, who is probably the most complex, conflicted and dramatic character in the series.</p>

<p>This book is a good read, but I yearn for the thrills and the sense of wonder of the previous installments that are conspicuously absent here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="baldurs_gate_2" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/baldurs_gate_2.jpg" width="196" height="257" />The Baldur&rsquo;s Gate franchise is the most popular single-player RPG series out there for good reasons, even though it&rsquo;s been a few years since its release. While more recent Black Isle games, notably Icewind Dale II, have vastly improved graphics and interface and others like Neverwinter Nights have changed the playing field entirely, BGII stands out for its tremendous scope and exceptional depth. BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading. To me that&rsquo;s the essence of RPG that few others have been able to capture. Reinforcing this feeling, at many points in the game you must make decisions that have far-reaching consequences. Furthermore, you can also complete many quests using the good or evil approach. You may decide how to proceed based on whether you want to be good or evil; there are non-player characters (NPCs) of both alignments ready to assist you.</p>

<p>BGII&rsquo;s strongest asset is its quests. While some quests are short and easily completed, most are substantial, highly interesting, and many engender their own sub-quests. For instance, one quest requires you to infiltrate a thieves guild suspected of treason; to gain their trust, you must finish several tasks for them; after you gather evidence of their treason, you&rsquo;re asked to go back and eliminate the guild leader; if you&rsquo;re successful, you then have the option of becoming the new leader and manage your own guild. It&rsquo;s possible to finish the game doing only the minimum handful of quests, but you&rsquo;d be missing a big part of the game. Similarly, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to complete all quests in one run, because the quests you get depend on the decisions you make. For instance, you can side either with the thieves&#8217; guild or the rival vampires&#8217; guild, each of which comes with its own storyline and quests. Most of the quests are initiated at the beginning of the game in Athkatla. Subsequently, quests become smaller and more linear.</p>

<p>Characters are tightly intertwined with quests. Since you start off with only one player, you should add additional characters to your party. Characters range from elven cleric/wizard to human ranger/stalker. Some are carry-overs from BG1. Some are found only if you accept certain quests, and some come with their own quests. You can interact with virtually any character in the game. Each character has his/her own history, alignment, and personality. From time to time, characters in your party will initiate dialogues with you and with one another, most with some amount of actual voice dialogue. Some interactions are quite funny; I&rsquo;ve chuckled many times with Minsc and Jan in my party. One feature that I suspect to be very popular is romance with characters in your party. If you meet certain conditions, a male player can romance with one of three female NPCs and a female player can romance with one male NPC. Romance are simply additional dialogues that you go through during lulls between battles. They don&rsquo;t add significantly to the plot, but they&rsquo;re an extra dimension that adults may appreciate.</p>

<p>A new feature in BGII is the &ldquo;stronghold&rdquo;. The stronghold you get depends on your class. For instance, the fighter stronghold is a keep outside of Athkatla, while the thieves stronghold is a guild headquarter in the Docks district. Strongholds are gained after you complete a certain quest; they generate gold for your coffers and come with their own mini-quests at intervals. They&rsquo;re not essential to the story, but they add immensely to the illusion of role-playing. Another great new feature is familiars, small pet-like creatures that follow you and obey your orders. There are many tricks you can do with familiars, but mostly they&rsquo;re just cool to have.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played BG1, the premise is that you&rsquo;re the illegitimate child of Bhaal, the God of Murder. After you defeated your nemesis at the end of BG1, your party was ambushed and taken prisoner. You wake up in a dark dungeon and find yourself tortured and apparently experimented upon by an unknown wizard. The game begins as the dungeon are invaded by hooded assailants and you are released. Now you must fight your way out of the dungeons and discover the identity of your captor and thwart his nefarious plan. You will explore the vast city Athkatla as well as travel to many exotic destinations such as an extra-planar prison, an underwater Sahuagin city, the Underdark, the elven city Suldanessellar, even the Nine Hells! There are innumerable dungeons and ruins along the way for your to explore. If any game is able to truly capture the dungeon exploring feel of D&amp;D, this is it!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll encounter a virtual encyclopedic list of monsters, including golems, vampires, liches, beholders, mind-flayers, werewolves, demons, and dragons. Some are immensely powerful and require much tactical planning on your part. Mastering spells and understanding their effects and limitations are a must. This is a hard task as there are 300 spells of all types in the game. Enemy spellcasters have powerful magical protections that make them virtually invincible. However, every protection spell has some form of counter. To successfully attack them, you must use the appropriate counter-spells to weaken their defense. Game play is fast and furious. Battles are not as large as those in IWD2 and are more oriented toward magical duelling, which is equally if not more fun.</p>

<p>The sprite graphics and animations are unspectacular by modern standards, but they are no longer noticeable once you become immersed in the game. Background graphics is gorgeous eye-candy, however, particularly the Sahuagin city, the Underdark, and Suldanessellar. The soundtrack and voice-over work are superb.</p>

<p>BGII has very high-replay value thanks to its breadth and richness. If you like RPG games, this one is a must-have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="AStormOfSwords" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/AStormOfSwords.jpg" width="200" height="290" />With this third hit in a row, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.</p>

<p>Elements that make the first two book great are all here: tightly crafted narratives, convincing and memorable characters, realistic dialogues, exotic locales, and intriguing plots. Martin continues to make bold strokes which are completely unexpected. He introduces the point-of-view of Jaime Lannister for the first time. The Kingslayer turns out to be a far more complex character than his reputation thus far may indicate. More than ever before, readers will be completely unsure whom to root for. Martin goes on to eliminate a major character who had appeared certain to survive the series. This may come as a complete shock to many, even to those who have come to expect the unexpected. It would be wise not to become too attached to any character. Nonetheless, I must admit to having grown rather fond of little Arya and her nightly litany of the villains on her &ldquo;hitlist&rdquo; (Joffrey, the Tickler, the Hound, Ralf the Sweetling, etc.)</p>

<p>In the aftermaths of the Battle of the Blackwater, the field of contenders for the throne is narrowed considerably. Stannis retreats to Dragonstone to lick his wounds, while the Lannisters form new alliances and are stronger than ever. Now firmly ensconced on the Iron Throne, Joffrey rules with unbridled cruelty, and only Tyrion dares to stand up to him. In the north, Robb is beset on all sides and the future looks even bleaker for the Starks. Bran is gradually gaining awareness of his shapeshifting ability in his journey to the north in search of the three-eyed crow. Arya faces many perils on her wanderings, but is getting closer to home. Sansa is more miserable than ever, but is becoming stronger and wiser. Jon makes a fateful decision that would ultimately gain him great esteem, but leave him with a broken heart. In the east, Daenerys is building a formidable army; when her dragons become fully grown, she would become invincible indeed. Samwell Tarly gets his fair share of space, though he&rsquo;s one of the few characters who don&rsquo;t appear to have much impact, yet.</p>

<p>The story has grown more complex and the setting has become richer than ever. Martin has gotten a real mess on his hand, and whatever the outcome of the series, it would be phenomenal. The only complaint anyone could have against the series is the wait between installments. But if the first three books are any indication, it is well worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="AGameOfThrones" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/AGameOfThrones-198x300.jpg" width="198" height="300" />George RR Martin&rsquo;s Song of Ice and Fire series receives almost universal acclaim from reviewers. I picked up A Game of Thrones after seeing it recommended by several reviewers. Since it is billed as the entry into an epic fantasy series, I half-expected to see a fantastic world populated by magic wielders and magical creations. Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin&rsquo;s medieval universe. In fact, this book reads more like historical documentary than fantasy fiction.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s Seven Kingdoms supposedly resembles 15th-century England during the War of the Roses with the Starks and Lannisters representing the York and Lancaster families, respectively. Even the map of the Seven Kingdoms bears vague resemblance the map of Great Britain, with a vast unexplored ocean to the west, a barbaric, frozen land to the north and ancient, exotic realms to the south and east. At the forefront is the conflict between the honorable Starks of Winterfell and the cunning, powerful Lannisters of Casterly Rock for control of the Iron Throne. In the beginning of AGoT, Ned Stark finds himself installed as the right-hand man of the King, his old friend, while Lannister influence is exerted through Cersei, the beautiful but cruel Queen. Interwoven throughout are myriad other characters who weave their own intrigues and schemes. In the north, barbaric tribes and direwolves threaten to overrun the &ldquo;Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall&rdquo; guarding the Kingdoms from the frozen wastes. Worse yet, there are glimpses of the Others, mysterious undead creatures, and their army of wights raised from the dead. In the east, a Dragon princess lives among horse warriors dreaming to one day retake the throne that had belonged to her father.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s universe is distinguished by its realism. The characters behave as real people would, in realistic if not predictable fashions, with entirely believable motives. I found that reading Martin is frequently frustrating, as there is no clear line of demarcation between good and evil so common in other fantasy works. Yes, the Starks are probably good and the Lannisters likely evil, but there are many gray areas. Seeming heroes commit heinous acts, while supposed villains are entirely sympathetic. If you expect to cheer for good and see evil punished, you would be sorely disappointed, not just with AGoT but likely with the entire series. In fact, for most of the 3 books written thus far, the side of good seems to be sorely persecuted. You just have to accept things the way they are, that good and evil go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Martin seems to revel in the anti-heroes. I can&rsquo;t recall how many times I&rsquo;ve encountered dashing leading men/women and their equally winsome companions in other works. Here, beauty and wholesomeness often hide vile intentions and a cruel character &mdash; think Cersei &mdash; while Tyrion&rsquo;s deformities and ugliness disguise a truly noble spirit.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s world is undeniably dark. The Seven Kingdoms is a violent world, where blood is spilled and lives are snuffed with little pretext or remorse. There is no uplifting conclusion, no triumph of good over evil. In fact, the mood at the end is decidedly downcast as a major character meets with a tragic end. However, there are lighthearted moments, such as those involving little Arya. Tyrion also has many funny lines, in a sarcastic sort of way.</p>

<p>This brilliant novel definitely breaks new ground, and quite a few stereotypes, in the fantasy genre. If this book is any indication, this promise to be phenomenal series indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went for a short hike over the long Labor Day weekend. To get there we drove through very picturesque Lincoln Center. Note to self: come back here for a bike ride in the fall. The trail head is located at the back of the very unremarkable parking lot for the local commuter train station.</p>

<p>Despite its formidable and romantic name, Mount Misery is anything but. It&rsquo;s a relatively small hill which barely rises above the tree line. However, the trail leading to it, albeit short, is full of highlights. We were greeted by several of the shy and elusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebird">blue birds</a>. Very tall coniferous trees line both sides of the trail and lush ferns cover the ground. This part brings me back to Sequoia National Park. Another stretch bisects a field of goldenrods buzzing with an army of honeybees. The trail runs through Lindentree Farms, complete with rusty old tractors and a chicken coop. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve walked through a farm!</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="http://www321.pair.com/oaries/localattitude/mountmisery.htm">excellent directions</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account. According to <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/webdevelopertips/archive/2009/10/02/tip-98-did-you-know-the-default-application-pool-identity-in-iis-7-5-windows-7-changed-from-networkservice-to-apppoolidentity.aspx">an IIS Team blog</a>, the user account associated with ApplicationPoolIdentity is actually <code>IIS AppPool\&lt;App pool name&gt;</code>. The intention is to further reinforce app pool isolation through the use of a separate user account for each app pool.</p>

<p>To grant permission to ApplicationPoolIdentity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the IIS Manager</li>
<li>Right-click on the desired virtual directory or application and select Edit Permission. Alternatively, you could have used Windows Explorer to browse to the physical path and open its Properties panel.</li>
<li>On the Security tab, select Edit, then Add</li>
<li>If the location is set to the domain, select Locations and change it to the local machine</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Wizard's_First_Rule" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Wizards_First_Rule-202x300.jpg" width="202" height="300" />If you&rsquo;re looking for an enthralling fantasy epic, look no further than the Sword of Truth series. Though Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule isn&rsquo;t the best of the series, it&rsquo;s a must-read because it sets the background for the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Richard Cypher, a simple woods guide from the land of Hartland, has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman and soon finds himself at the center of quest to prevent a magic box of vast power from falling into the hands of Darken Rahl, a &ldquo;dark&rdquo; wizard of with unimaginable power and unsurpassed cruelty. Richard is guided by beautiful Kahlan, who possesses a mysterious but deadly ability, and Zedd, a kindly, eccentric old wizard who is more powerful than he seems. He is also bestowed with a magic sword powered by unbridled fury. Along the way, which crosses his rustic Westland into the magical Midlands and dark D&#8217;Hara, he encounters sorceresses, otherworldly beasts, dangerous magical creatures, a savage cannibalistic people, and deadly spells. Richard has to learn how to use the magic of his sword and his inborn magic, as well as the eponymous wizard&rsquo;s rule, if he is to succeed. Will he survive the encounter with a Mord-Sith, a leather-clad torturer who inflicts terrible pain or death as easily as the flick of a wrist, in order to even have a chance to stop Rahl, who commands the powers of the underworld?</p>

<p>In this debut, Goodkind did a good job of painting his magical universe and introducing the protagonists. The first half proceeds slowly, filled with trivial adventures and rather poorly realized characters. At times his dialogues are so bland and sappy that they may induce squirms. If you find yourself feeling that way, stick with it; the series, and the writing, vastly improves with subsequent books. In the second half of the book, the pace picks up significantly. Goodkind is an expert at crafting plots. The fast-paced, furious actions and the heart-pounding thrills of the climax may leave you emotionally spent, yet satisfied, at the end. Believe it or not, the climax will resolve most major plot threads, something I wish other authors (read: Robert Jordan) would do more often, while leaving enough open for the next installment.</p>

<p>Goodkind&rsquo;s world is less complex than others. The New World, composed of Westland, Midlands, and D&#8217;Hara, is where magic still has a hold, while the much more vast, mostly unknown, Old World is devoid of magic. Most of Richard&rsquo;s adventures take place in Midlands, though its geography and people aren&rsquo;t all known at first; new kingdoms and realms are introduced along the way. Like many other fantasy realms, Goodkind-land of the present has but a shell of the richness and splendor of the past, in this case 3000 years ago before the time of the Great War. The number of magic wielders diminishes with each passing generation, and the magic that remains is no longer as powerful as it once was. Goodkind&rsquo;s &ldquo;magic&rdquo; is a complex and mysterious entity, not as well characterized as, say, Robert Jordan&rsquo;s One Power. Wizards and sorceresses call on their &ldquo;Han&rdquo; to cast &ldquo;webs&rdquo; of magic, or they can conjure spells and embed them in or invoke them from magical objects. Some aspects of the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; are unexpected, such as the ability to see or interpret prophecy. It&rsquo;s not always clear what magic can or cannot accomplish. Adding to that are the humans and creatures, created with or warped by magic and themselves possess unique magical abilities. The resulting mix can be confusing, but leads to exciting, unexpected possibilities.</p>

<p>Unlike many other fantasy epics, Goodkind&rsquo;s heroes are threatened by a variety of evil characters. The Sauron/Dark One archetype is represented here by the Keeper of the Underworld; besides that there are the evil wizard, Darken Rahl, evil spirits, evil underworld forces, evil beasts, evil humans. In the latter part of the series, the principal antagonist is an evil emperor with a deadly power. Added to the mix are secondary entities who are no less dangerous and disruptive, such as the Blood of the Fold and the Sisters of the Dark. Good-doers are never completely safe in this world.</p>

<p>One appealing aspect of the series is the human relationship between the characters. Complex, profound, and very human emotions are always there, bubbling beneath the surface, ready to burst open. Readers can&rsquo;t help but find themselves taking a personal interest in the well-being of many characters. On the flip side, Goodkind also fashion many twisted villains who can exasperate and infuriate &mdash; a tribute to his craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Goodkind brings a mix of many adult themes to the story. This is not a series for young readers, though I don&rsquo;t think Goodkind&rsquo;s writings is as graphically perverse as some reviewers have claimed. He crosses the line occasionally, but for the most part doesn&rsquo;t do more than is necessary for advancing the plot. The inclusion of themes can make his world &ldquo;darker&rdquo; than kinder, gentler places such as Jordan&rsquo;s. Aside from the usual mix of love, lust, sexuality, loyalty, treachery, there are touches on infidelity, homosexuality, human sacrifice, prostitution, slavery, pedophelic practice, misogyny. Goodkind&rsquo;s world is also violent, one in which blood is spilled copiously and without remorse. Nevertheless, these attributes make Goodkind&rsquo;s world more realistic and potentially appealing to the mature reader.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My computer got a dose of malware today.   The trojan got a hold of my USB drive.  It made all of my files and folders hidden, then injected executables with the same names.  It also hid the .exe extension so that the executables appeared in place of the legitimate objects they were masquerading.  It gave the fake folders the right icon so that they looked just like folders.  The objective is to fool the user into double-clicking the folders to open them but instead executing the trojan.</p>

<p><img title="malware" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/malware.png" width="477" height="206" /></p>

<p><figcaption>Malware executable masquerading as folder. With the normal Windows settings, the original folder &ldquo;backup&rdquo; is not shown because it is set to &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;. The malware executable &ldquo;backup.exe&rdquo; looks like a real folder because it has a folder icon and its &ldquo;exe&rdquo; extension is not shown.</figcaption></p>

<p>Sure enough, being careless, I fell for the trick.  The trojan installed a &ldquo;scareware&rdquo; Malware and Spyware scanner; whoever the authors are, they are not without a perverse sense of humor.  The fake scanner &ldquo;detected&rdquo; random programs on the hard drive as malware.  If you fall for the legitimate-sounding messages, you undoubted would be sending them your credit card information at some point.  Now only an idiot would do that (apologies to those who actually did).  This trojan is not a one-trick pony.  It has a fairly standard bag of tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>It  modifies Windows&#8217; Registry so that it would be loaded automatically when the computer boots</li>
<li>It modifies the Windows Hosts file to redirect google.com, yahoo.com and bing.com to ad sites</li>
<li>It changes your IE homepage to point to its own site</li>
<li>If you start Task Manager or any other program, it immediately kills it so that you have no control whatsoever of the computer with the only recourse to click on the link that the fake scanner provides</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point, it looked like I was stuck.  I finally managed to kill the fake scanner&rsquo;s process (defender.exe) from Task Manager with some quick fingers.  It helps to be familiar with keyboard shortcuts.  Once I regained control of the computer, I used <a href="http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis">HijackThis</a> to remove the infection from the Hosts file, IE and Registry. I manually deleted the executables referenced in the registry.  Then I put the computer through a rigorous scan with <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">MalwareBytes</a>.</p>

<p>To cleanse the USB drive, simply select Tools  > Folder Options > View in Windows Explorer. Select <code>Show hidden files and folders</code> and uncheck <code>Hide extensions for known file types</code>.  This allows you to see the hidden original folders.  You can simply delete the fake files and folders.  To be able to see the files and folders normally,  you&rsquo;ll have to turn off the hidden and system attributes.  You can do so with the command <code>attrib -h -s "file name"</code>.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll have to go change all of my passwords.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Model=939Dual-SATA2">ASRock 939Dual-SATA2</a> motherboard is a little long in the tooth but still quite capable.  Mine has been running Windows XP Media Center Edition for some time and I decided to upgrade it to Windows 7.  The challenge is that the motherboard&rsquo;s JMicron SATA2 chipset isn&rsquo;t detected automatically at installation.  If you want to install Windows on a SATA hard drive, you will have to load the driver first.  The other problem is that, as of the time of writing, there is no Windows 7 driver for the ULi integrated Ethernet controller due to the age of the hardware.  You would have find another workaround for this issue.</p>

<h1>Installing Windows</h1>

<p>Download the drivers for the JMicron SATA2 controller from the <a href="http://www.ASRock.com/mb/download.asp?Model=939Dual-SATA2&amp;amp;o=XP">ASRock download site</a>.  The drivers are for Windows XP but they will work for Windows 7.  Expand the archive and put them on a USB drive.</p>

<p>Pop in the installation DVD.  When the computer starts up, hit F2 to enter set-up.  Make sure that  SATA2 controller is enabled and running in SATA mode instead of IDE mode.  Verify that the SATA hard drive is detected.  Under the Boot menu, select the DVD drive as the primary boot device.  Alternatively, I could have also used a bootable USB drive or copied the files to the IDE hard drive and run the installation from there.  For me, booting from DVD was just simpler.</p>

<p>When the prompt comes up, hit any key to boot from the DVD.</p>

<p>At the screen where the available hard drives and partitions are listed, you will probably not see your SATA hard drive.  Select Load Driver and browse to the Floppy32 (yes, floppy) folder on the USB drive.  A JMicron SATA2 driver should be listed.  Select it and the installer will load the drivers.  After this step you should see the SATA hard drive listed.  I formatted the drive as well, as in my case installation didn&rsquo;t succeed otherwise.</p>

<p>After a couple of reboots, Windows 7 should be good to go.</p>

<h1>Installing the LAN drivers</h1>

<p>Windows 7 won&rsquo;t be able to find drivers for the ULi integrated Ethernet controller.  If you have a USB Ethernet adapter or a second Ethernet adapter with which you can use to go online, you could simply tell Windows to update the driver for the ULi controller and it would do so successfully.  I didn&rsquo;t have either option so I had to use another machine to transfer the drivers.</p>

<p>As pointed out on <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproinstall/thread/865bdb49-3b6a-461c-8aa2-166%20586c457c3">this forum thread</a>, you can use the ULi LAN 352 drivers.  These are intended for Windows Vista, but they work fine for Windows 7.  From the other machine, <a href="ftp://download.asrock.com/drivers/ULi/LAN/Lan(352">download</a>.zip) the driver package from the ASRock download site.  The package contains an EXE.  Since you probably won&rsquo;t want to install the drivers on the wrong machine, you can open the EXE file (yes, EXE) with Winrar or another archiver and extract its content to a USB drive.</p>

<p>Back in Windows 7, open the Device Manager and locate the Ethernet device (which shows a yellow exclamation mark).  Select Update Driver, then Browse for Driver.  Browse to the USB drive.  There are 32- and 64-bit flavors of the Vista drivers. Select the appropriate one for your Windows installation.  The device will show up as the ULi M526X Ethernet controller.</p>
