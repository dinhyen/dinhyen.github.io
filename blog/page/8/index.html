  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re using <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/">AutoMapper</a> in ASP.NET MVC automate the mapping of properties between entity and view model objects.  This is a highly useful tool which helps us avoid the tedium of having to assigning properties manually.  Here&rsquo;s a good <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2009/01/23/automapper-the-object-object-mapper/">introduction</a> to using AutoMapper.</p>

<p>In one case, I find that the AutoMapper doesn&rsquo;t work for all properties.  One property in particular doesn&rsquo;t get mapped.  If I manually assign a value to it as a test, I would get a ForeignKeyReferenceAlreadyHasValueException.</p>

<p>The entity looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Order</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">CustomerId</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Person</span> <span class="n">Customer</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The view model is similar, but I pull out just the customer&rsquo;s name into a string since it is all I need. For simplicity I decide to re-use the property name. This seems intuitive and is a common practice for us before we started using the AutoMapper.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OrderViewModel</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">CustomerId</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">Customer</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Mapping the view model to the entity is accomplished with a simple statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="n">AutoMapper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Mapper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Map</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">OrderViewModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Order</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="n">orderViewModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To map things the other way requires a similar statement:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="n">AutoMapper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Mapper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Map</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">Order</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">OrderViewModel</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">orderViewModel</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I find that the CustomerId property would not get mapped in either scenario.</p>

<p>It turns out that the problem is caused by using a &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; property name. In the entity, Customer is a Person object which is created from the foreign key CustomerId via LINQ to SQL, so Customer and CustomerId are intimately connected. In the view model, CustomerId matches that in the entity, but Customer is of a different type. The conflict causes the AutoMapper to abort mapping either of these properties.</p>

<p>There are a couple of workarounds.  The simplest solution is to rename the Customer property in the view model to something else which doesn&rsquo;t clash, such as CustomerName.  The nice thing about AutoMapper is that by convention you can map properties of an object simply by appending it to the object&rsquo;s property name. So the Person.Name property would get mapped to CustomerName, Person.Phone would get mapped to CustomerPhone and so on.</p>

<p>Alternatively, since I only care about CustomerId, I can simply tell AutoMapper to ignore the Customer property altogether:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// From view model to entity</span>

<p>These mapping conventions should be declared once, before the mapping operation is performed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As far as big mountain goes,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock%22%20targtet=%22_blank"> Mount Monadnock</a> in the southwestern corner of New Hampshire is relatively close to Boston.  Despite its proximity, we&rsquo;ve never set foot on it. So we set out on a beautiful Saturday morning to redress this omission.</p>

<p><img src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/monadnock/dsc_3497.jpg" alt="Mount Monadnock" /></p>

<p>Monadnock&rsquo;s claim to fame is its status as most hiked mountain in the US.  Not so surprisingly, as soon as we arrived, the park ranger informed us that the parking lot was filled so that we&rsquo;d have to park in the camping area.  Later on, we&rsquo;d encounter people of all ages, shapes and sizes on the trail.</p>

<p>One of Kate&rsquo;s friend, who had hiked here before, wryly observed that the people who designed this trail had no idea what a switchback was.  True enough, the White Dot trail which begins at the nearby Visitor&rsquo;s Center is a straight shot to the summit. But luckily there are also other trails which offer more gradual albeit circuitous ascent.</p>

<p>The plan was to take the White Dot trail up and White Cross trail down.  Ascending involves clambering on all fours several times.  Near the start of the trail, a guy passed us going up, walking at an extremely fast pace.  About half-way up, he passed us on the way <em>down</em>.  Granted, we did stop frequently to enjoy the scenery, but we were no newbie hikers either.  Two-thirds of the way up, he passed us again going up, albeit more slowly this time.  I chatted briefly with him.  Turns out he routinely climbs this &ldquo;short&rdquo; mountain twice per visit, having practiced enough that it takes only 30 minutes per leg.  But even more impressive is his friend, who can do the same thing at the age of 54 and who has a resting heart rate of something like 40.  Anything lower than that and one wouldn&rsquo;t be breathing.  Needless to say, having heard all this, we re-doubled our efforts!  As we neared the peak, as expected we ran into our friend again practically running downhill.</p>

<iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=214490968088440958659.0004acb6af81f69e7ec25&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.853178,-72.098114&amp;spn=0.016689,0.020165&amp;t=m&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;output=embed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="600" height="450"></iframe>


<p>The view at the top was spectacular.  We were lucky to get a beautiful and relatively clear day.  We could see the majestic ridges of the White Mountains to the north and the very faint, barely perceptible in the haze, outline of the twin towers of the Boston skyline in the southeast horizon.</p>

<p>The trail systems here were partly created by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> in 1931-1933 during the Great Depression.  We&rsquo;ve seen their work in many of the places we&rsquo;ve visited.  One can only hope that after this Great Recession we&rsquo;ll have left something as worthwhile to posterity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Broadmoor/index.php">Broadmoor</a> is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary.  Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet.  Despite sounding like something out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles">The Hounds of the Baskervilles</a>, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River.  In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.</p>

<p><img src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/broadmoor/dsc_3665.jpg" alt="Broadmoor" /></p>

<p>Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.  If you like boardwalks&mdash;who doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;this is for you.  While <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Moose_Hill/index.php">Moose Hill</a> has picturesque boardwalks and <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php">Ipswich</a> has fun boardwalks (including some boardwalk/bridge combo which we&rsquo;d propose be christened &ldquo;boardbridge&rdquo;), Broadmoor&rsquo;s boardwalks expand into wide platforms which give you more room to lounge on while enjoying the spectacular views.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t see many of our avian friends the last time we were there.  But I had a bit of fun with the miniature waterfalls at Mill Pond. The rust-colored water laced with reflections of the blue sky gives it an interesting variegated appearance.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="althalus" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/althalus.jpg" width="186" height="272" />Having plowed through three multi-volume fantasy series in a row, I thought this single-volume tome, the first standalone fantasy adventure by the husband-and-wife team, might be a welcome respite. I haven&rsquo;t read any book by the Eddingses, but their reputation as prolific and popular authors is well-known. I was further intrigued by the &ldquo;#1 international bestseller&rdquo; plug emblazoned on the hardcover.</p>

<p>The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary. He&rsquo;s also a braggart and a liar of epic proportions. Plagued by a streak of uncharacteristic bad luck, he accepts a job from a shady character to steal a Book in the House at the End of the World. He finds the Book but is detained by a talking cat, who is in reality the goddess Dweia in disguise. Dweia persuades him to be her agent, and they recruit others to join their team, including a warrior, a priest, a queen, a mind-reader, and a young thief. Together they engage in epic struggles with agents of the Evil God, who seeks to undo all creation and return the universe to nothingness.</p>

<p>That the names of the authors are in larger fonts than the title of the book should have been a warning bell, I suppose. To be fair, the story is somewhat interesting. The concept of a House that compresses space and time, and that allows one to travel vast distances or time by simply going down the hallway, is a novel idea. Throw in a few modern concepts, such as the time-space duality and even the procedure for rudimentary brain surgery, and the story has a distinct sci-fi feel. Nevertheless, the plot is more or less predictable, straightforward action-adventure with a smattering of romance: Althalus and friends recruit an army, goes here, repel an invasion, fall in love, goes there, fight another war, go some place else, defeat the bad guys, etc. The pace is, for lack of a better word, unchanged. It&rsquo;s the same whether the characters are cuddling or fighting for their lives. The authors seem to be on cruise control throughout; they seem to be recounting a story fact by fact, instead of portraying it, making it come alive. The feeling is comparable to watching a documentary film versus an action movie or drama. The cookie-cutter characters are rather flat and two-dimensional. So they are all different in their attributes and abilities, but nothing else distinguishes one from the other. They all make the same cliche wisecracks, punts, or sarcastic remarks. Some merit a chuckle or two, but after a while one is left to wonder whether or not there is anything else to them. In fact, I can&rsquo;t even envision what each character looks like; I&rsquo;d like to see more than just tall/short, big/tiny, dark-haired/blond, beautiful/ugly, etc. Contrast this with the works of some other authors, such as George Martin, who lavishes attention on the description of the wardrobe alone. Of course, characterization goes beyond superficial appearance. There are other means, such as describing how events unfold from the character&rsquo;s point of view, that can bring the point across. Unfortunately such richness and attention to details are absent here. Similarly, the writing is competent, but lacks a certain sophistication and seriousness demonstrated by some other authors. The book is entertaining if you&rsquo;re in the mood for casual reading, and I feel that it would be most appropriate for a younger audience rather than a serious fantasy fan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="thehalflingsgem" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/thehalflingsgem-178x300.jpg" width="178" height="300" />The end of the second volume leads right into the third. As the companions escaped from Mithral Hall, Regis fell into the clutches of Artemis Entreri, the deadly assassin hired by the leader of the thieves&#8217; guild in Calimport of whom Regis had run afoul. Furthermore, Entreri gained possession of the statuette that conjures the black panther Guenhwyvar, Drizzt&rsquo;s faithful extra-planar companion. Saddened by the loss of Bruenor and now Regis, Drizzt and Wulfgar resolve to track down the assassin to his lair and rescue their friend, while Catti-Brie is grimly determined to finish Bruenor&rsquo;s quest and retake Mithral Hall from the duergars.</p>

<p>After the excitement of volume two, there is a bit of a let-down. After all, the action doesn&rsquo;t really pick up until Drizzt and Wulfgar near the end of their destination. After that, all hell breaks loose, literally. What follows is non-stop action. The party must survive an ambush in the city sewers, find an exit through the trap-filled thieves&#8217; guild, and escape from an an astral plane filled with bloodthirsty demons. All the while, Drizzt is drawn inexorably toward a confrontation with Entreri, who&rsquo;s his equal in every physical aspect and martial skill, yet is his polar opposite in spirit and morality. As expected, Drizzt&rsquo;s duel with Entreri is the highlight of the story, though unfortunately it ends without a resolution. Drizzt&rsquo;s emotional saga continues, as he struggles to be comfortable with his physical appearance, and succeeds in gaining a small measure of acceptance by the nobility of his actions. Yes, the dour ranger may be capable of even love, as the little confession from Catti-Brie seems to indicate. Die-hard Drizzt fans may not want to miss the moment he plants a wet kiss on Catti-Brie&rsquo;s lips, though whether she is aware of it is unclear.</p>

<p>As serious as the story seems, RA Salvatore&rsquo;s naming scheme may need a little more work. Many of the names are original, but some, like Wulfgar, Alustriel, Morkai, etc. come off as a little generic. Drizzt&rsquo;s name for his scimitar, &ldquo;Twinkle&rdquo;, hardly befits a deadly weapon. I hope his nickname for Guenhwyvar isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Pussycat&rdquo;. My last complaint has to do with the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for Mithral Hall. That&rsquo;s just it, there is no battle. I had looked forward to seeing the combined forces of barbarians, dwarves, and wizards rout the despised duergars. Instead, the author seems to have run out of his page quota and only devotes a few brief passages to the party&rsquo;s triumphant return to Mithral Hall. Somewhat disappointing, but I suppose by this time the book will already have fulfilled its purpose.</p>

<p>While this book doesn&rsquo;t quite measure up to Streams of Silver, congratulations for putting this series under your belt. Now you can join Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden in his next exciting adventure, be it in Menzoberranzan or Faerun. If you don&rsquo;t feel intrigued with Drizzt after having read this series, I&rsquo;m a bearded gnome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="thecrystalshard" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/thecrystalshard-181x300.jpg" width="181" height="300" />The main problem with works that are inspired by or that borrow from RPG is predictability. After all, what adventure would be complete without a warrior, a rogue, and a sorcerer. Not to mention the party must include a gruff dwarf and a light-hearted, pleasure-loving halfling. The Crystal Shard has got all that and more, but it also brings to life an original in the form of Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden, who&rsquo;s undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved characters in fantasy. That may be the most enduring legacy of this fun if otherwise unremarkable series.</p>

<p>The story is set in the Icewind Dale, a barren, wind-swept region nestled in the armpit of the Spine of the World. Thanks to its remote location, Icewind Dale is largely ignored, until our present story that is, in the lores of the Forgotten Realms, that fabled realm of the vast Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. Icewind Dale is home to Bruenor, a old, curmudgeonly dwarf (who&rsquo;s ever heard of a happy go lucky dwarf?), who fled here after the destruction of his ancestral home, and the halfing Regis, an epicurean who&rsquo;s on the run from some trouble in the south. Befriended to both is Drizzt, a drow-elf ranger on an self-imposed exile from the underground realms of his people. Highly principled and strongly disturbed by the evil and self-serving ways of the drow, he willingly makes his home on the surface world despite the fear and revulsion of almost everyone he comes across. Drizzt&rsquo;s background and emotional complexity makes him a deeper characters than one would expect from a series like this. Rounding out the group are Catti-Brie, a human girl adopted by Bruenor, and Wulfgar, a fierce barbarian warrior taken under Bruenor&rsquo;s tutelage. Trouble brews when Akar Kessell, a bumbling wizard&rsquo;s apprentice, stumbled into possession of Crenshinibon, an almost sentient crystal imbued with vast powers. Aided by the crystal, Kessell assembles a vast army of goblins, orcs and giants to invade Ten Towns and establish himself as the tyrant of Icewind Dale. Drizzt and company must rally the squabbling inhabitants of Ten Towns and gain the help of the hitherto hostile barbarian tribes if everyone is to have a chance.</p>

<p>As transparent as the plot may seem, there are memorable moments such as Drizzt&rsquo;s confrontation with the demon Erttu and Wulfgar&rsquo;s journey to the lair of the ice dragon. This was RA Salvatore&rsquo;s first major work and there are some rough edges here and there. The battle of Bryn Shander somehow lacks the fury and scale of a climactic clash (face it, few are going to be able to outdo the battles of Helm&rsquo;s Deep and the Pelennor Fields). Nevertheless, the author does an excellent job to bring excitement to one-on-one swashbuckling; one can almost envision the blur of Drizzt&rsquo;s dual scimitars or Wulfgar hammering everything into smithereens with mighty Aegis-Fang.</p>

<p>The Crystal Shard has something about each character. While I would have wished for less stereotypical portrayals and a little more depth, it&rsquo;s a satisfactory introduction and launches us immediately into the companions&#8217; even more exciting second adventure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="ArtOfLOTR" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/artoflotr.jpg" width="185" height="241" />Bringing Tolkien&rsquo;s Middle Earth to life is a monumental task. The locations, creatures and monsters have to be conceptualized, designed and created from the ground up. Capturing the spirit of Tolkien&rsquo;s work is an even more daunting challenge because of its tremendous scope, complexity and beauty. Furthermore, its legions of fans are staunch in their visions of Tolkien&rsquo;s universe, and satisfying all of them is impossible.</p>

<p>That the movie has been a phenomenal success and, more importantly, an incredible realization of Tolkien&rsquo;s visions is a testament to the skills and dedication of Peter Jackson and his team. The most visible aspect of the movie is the artistry underlying the costumes, weapons, architecture, and scenics. Jackson&rsquo;s most far-reaching impact was perhaps his decision to bring in two of the most influential Tolkien artists, Alan Lee and John Howe, as art directors. Both have illustrated Tolkien for a long time and in many cases their works have become widely accepted if not standard interpretations of Tolkien. The artists and their talented teams are responsible for virtually every element of the movie. Indeed, the production designs have the look and feel of works of art. The most direct result is the movie&rsquo;s breathtaking beauty, which exceeds even the most fertile imagination among Tolkien fans. A secondary result is the harmony and consistency of artistic elements and designs from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The book is a comprehensive chronicle of the art of the movie. Its 192 pages are lavishly illustrated with lush color photographs and gorgeous drawings and paintings. The book is divided into four main chapters: Locations, Costumes, Armory, and Creatures.</p>

<p>The Locations chapter is further divided into sections that correspond to major locations. These are Bag End, Bree, Weathertop, Isengard, Rivendell, The Misty Mountains, Lothlorien, Anduin, and Amon Hen. I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare in stupefied silence at the paradise-like beauty of Rivendell or the alien grace and intricacy of Lothlorien. This section alone is worth the price of the book. The architectural pencil drawings are outstanding. Many excellent designs were created even though only a few eventually made it into the movie. If, like me, you get goose bumps when the camera sweeps through the hall of Dwarrowdelf, know that it&rsquo;s no coincidence.</p>

<p>The costume and armory designs are most conspicuous for their painstaking details. Each costume is unique and manages to evoke the characteristics of each race. Thus hobbits look like townspeople out for a stroll, human tunics are rugged and martial, dwarven armor exudes fine craftsmanship, and the flowing robes of the elves accentuate their delicate features and natural grace. The weapon designs follow the same line and display remarkable details. Sauron&rsquo;s various armor designs are my favorite.</p>

<p>The Creatures chapter shows drawings, composites, maquettes, and sculptures of the various Orc races, the Uruk-Hais, the troll, the Watcher, the Ringwraiths, and the Balrog. The design of the Watcher illustrates the high artistic standard of the designers. Tolkien never described the Watcher in details, so many outstanding designs were considered and rejected before one was finally selected. Of all the creatures that stalk, crawl and fly in the movie, perhaps the Balrog is the most awe-inspiring. The Balrog is another creature that Tolkien only briefly described. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the various interpretations, from reptilian to winged humanoids to centaur-like. The end result of all this is one of the most awesome monsters on the silver screen.</p>

<p>This treasure trove of artwork is a must-have not only for Tolkien lovers and fans of the movie but also for those who appreciate great fantasy art.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="streamsofsilver" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/streamsofsilver-182x300.jpg" width="182" height="300" />Good things come in trilogies and, in most cases, the second of the series is the best&hellip;Streams of Silver is perhaps the zenith of the Icewind Dale trilogy. There are plenty of exciting adventures, desperate battles, horrifying monsters, devious sorcerers, dark dungeons, but most importantly, there is an element of the unknown. In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination. However, this book is more than just swashbuckling and dungeon exploring. We gain an insight into the mind of Drizzt, the mental conflicts and emotional sacrifices he must endure to uphold his principles. Even though there isn&rsquo;t a neatly wrapped conclusion by the end, this book is proof that sometimes the journey is better than the destination!</p>

<p>The series continues with Bruenor, Wulfgar, Drizzt and Regis embarking on a quest to discover the doom that befell Bruenor&rsquo;s ancestral home, Mithral Hall. Many difficulties face the companions, not the least of which is the dwarf&rsquo;s inability to recollect even the approximate location of this underground kingdom, where precious mithril is so abundant that it flows in streams along the walls. Regis, on the other hand, is pursued by a deadly bounty-hunter intent on collecting his gem, and his head. The companions also attract the attention of a devious wizard of the Hosttower of the Arcane Brotherhood for their previous involvement with the crystal Crenshinibon. Along the way, the companions must deal with hordes of monsters, including trolls, ghostly unicorn, giant worm, bog monsters, even a banshee, but yet the assassin and his cohorts are ever their greatest threat. Once they rediscover Mithral Hall, they must be prepared to face its terrifying secret.</p>

<p>Of course, the essence and the main attraction of Dungeons &amp; Dragons are the dungeons themselves, where rich treasures await discovery and monsters may lurk around every corner. For me, the most exciting part of the Lord of the Rings, indeed of any fantasy, is Moria. There is much of Moria here. There is the central plot that the dwarves had delved too deep and unwittingly released a dormant horror. Then there is the companions&#8217; effort to solve a puzzle to open a hidden door and gain the entrance to the underground passage, and the climactic confrontation at a bridge over a chasm which leads to the exit from the mines. This is perhaps RA Salvatore&rsquo;s nod to his inspiration (he admitted that reading Tolkien had led to his interest in the genre). Nevertheless, there are much that are original here, and the plot is seldom predictable.</p>

<p>Of interest is the exploration of Drizzt&rsquo;s emotional depths. That he has refuted the ways of his people is clear, but here we also get to appreciate the emotional cost of his decision. There would come a time when the pain of his rejection by the surface world because of his dark elf heritage becomes unbearable. As Drizzt struggles to reconcile with his decision, he will need to draw on the support of his friends and on an unlikely source. Bruenor&rsquo;s conflict is also highlighted. All his life he has longed to return to the home of his childhood, of which he is the rightful king, yet he may need to realize that his true home belongs with the friends he has made.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an exciting buddy road adventure with strong character development that makes it much more well-rounded than it otherwise would be.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="rhapsodychildofblood" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/rhapsodychildofblood-180x300.jpg" width="180" height="300" />I was attracted to Rhapsody, the first book of the Rhapsody trilogy, by way of its critical acclaim as one of the best fantasy debut in years. The book does not disappoint. It&rsquo;s a marvellously executed masterpiece of high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien that we all know and love. The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist. In Rhapsody, the eponymous heroine is a young woman, half-human, half-Lirin (something akin to an elven race), a musician, singer, and Namer, the latter being a practioner of an art that allows her to create magic by invoking qualities associated with the name of someone or something. Being on the run from villains, she unwittingly enlists the help of two mysterious characters: a hideous, deadly assassin and a monstrous, wisecracking military sergeant. Both are themselves fugitives from an ancient, omnipotent evil. Together they embark on a long journey through the center of the world, and find themselves in a strange new land, in a time that may have been centuries removed from their own. With all that they have ever known long gone, they must struggle to explore their new world and combat a horror that may have followed them from the old world. Tied into all of this is the fate of two young lovers who are brought together for the briefest moments before being flung centuries apart.</p>

<p>Haydon portrays a heroine that is immediately likeable and sympathetic. She is vulnerable yet strong, innocent yet wise, naive yet experienced, gentle yet hardened. Her fierce independence, touched with a fiery temper, is balanced only by her boundless compassion and sense of justice. Unlike many other heroes, aside from her innate ability as a Namer who can perform magic with her voice and her music, she doesn&rsquo;t possess any other superhuman power. Even her skills have to be painstakingly learned and constantly practiced. She comes to master the use of the sword, but as the result of training, not inborn ability. This is a refreshing change from the Richard Rahl-stereotype who is given a magic sword and almost immediate gains the skills contained within it. The other two protagonists complement the heroine perfectly, and each has his own history and contribute significantly to the plot. The half-monstrous, possibly cannibalistic, sergeant is apt to dish out humorous one-liners, contrary to his fearsome appearance. The harsh, cruel assassin may yet learn to like and love Rhapsody as one of his own family. As the story progresses, the readers immerse in the intertwining lives of the three main characters and grow with them as they grow, until their peculiar relationship no longer seems strange but familiar and intimate.</p>

<p>Haydon has masterful command of the pen. Her prose is beautifully rendered; I often find myself going back over many a passage to fully relish and appreciate all of her words. She revels in bringing out details and manages to evoke not only sights but also sounds, somehow making them feel alive as if they could float out of the page. Her world is exotic, populated both strange and familiar races, creatures, and personae, brought to life with meticulous details. Her descriptive prose makes use of many modern scientific and technical elements, such as the description of nature of music and that of the physiology of a certain character. She bring to life many fantastic adventures. The passage through the center of the world is hardly a new concept, yet made startlingly so by very original ideas: the giant roots, the cleansing fire, the unimaginable horror dormant within. And of course, the ancient mountain realm of Canrif hasn&rsquo;t produced such breathless anticipation in me since the Fellowship entered Moria.</p>

<p>The pacing of the book is steady. There is indeed a climax at the end, but along the way Haydon sprinkles enough revelations to keep the reader enthralled. There is seldom a boring moment when you wish the author would just get on to the next point. Even when the pace seems to slow, the dialogues are a joy to read. Instead of being space fillers, the sometimes acerbic, oftentimes witty, always razor-sharp verbal repartees are a feast for the eyes. Rhapsody in particular, has a tremendous wit, and a sly humor that rivals that of her monstrous friend. Their verbal exchanges do a great deal to lighten the mood and speed the story along.</p>

<p>If any complaint can be found, it would be with certain characterization of the heroine. Surely, her femininity offers her certain unique advantages over her traditional male counterparts. For one thing, she usually gets overlooked as the underdog at the start of a fight; many an opponent would come to regret the mistake, if he lives through it. Secondly, however unwittingly, she is able to attract and seduce male characters simply with her appearance. This comes into play often as Rhapsody is possessive of a stunning, perfect beauty. In retrospect, I was wrong to have said she is blessed with no inborn gift. Rhapsody&rsquo;s beauty and its effect on men indeed prove powerful enough and significant enough to drive many major plot points. It&rsquo;s just too convenient and detracts from her other positive qualities. Perhaps, as an offset to this unfair advantage, Rhapsody is blissfully oblivious of her own beauty, stubbornly believing instead that men happen to stare at her because of her racially mixed&mdash;thus freakish and alien&mdash;appearance. This self-delusion is kept up for the whole book and into the next! Given her astute power of observation, it would be hard to believe such inanity, which can only be ascribed to either extreme naïveté or plain stupidity.</p>

<p>The other complaint I had, albeit only a minor one, is the speed with which the assassin character is able to build a powerful, sophisticated civilization from scattered tribes of a primitive people. In contrast, in Robert Jordan&rsquo;s universe, it took the hero the whole book and more to do more or less the same (on the other hand, as of now Jordan&rsquo;s series is also 10 books and counting, with the end nowhere in sight). Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t so much a weakness as a stretch in the mantle of believability, but this hardly detracts from the enjoyment of the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="JohnShawNaturePhotographyFieldGuide" src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/images/johnshawnaturephotographyfieldguide.jpg" width="166" height="220" />The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &ldquo;How did they do it?&rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy. This book, by well-known landscape and wildlife photographer John Shaw, will tell you exactly how <em>he</em> did it. In clear and concise prose, he explains in details his system for getting the exposure you want (as distinguished from simply determining the correct exposure). While this may not be earth-shattering or even entirely novel, its simplicity and ease of use will make you wonder why you didn&rsquo;t think of it before. It obviously works beautifully for Shaw. For me, this was the single most useful thing I got out of the book.</p>

<p>The rest of the book is geared more toward the beginning photographer with extensive coverage of basic principles of exposure, lens selection, composition, flash photography, etc. There is a surprisingly large section on close-ups, usually not the most well expounded topic in a general photography book. There are some advices on field gear and locations that a veteran photographer may find useful. Shaw does cover enough gear (mostly Nikon) to keep an equipment junkie happy. In all, true to the book&rsquo;s title as a &ldquo;field guide&rdquo;, the predominant theme is practicality, and you can actually put many of his suggestions to good use right away. Lastly, the book also has enough beautiful photos to be an impressive coffee table book.</p>

<p>I find Shaw&rsquo;s prose to be efficient and direct, not condescending or ingratiating as how-to books tend to get. The book is logically organized and compartmental; you will not have to read cover to cover to benefit from it. If you&rsquo;re interested in nature photography, this book would be a worthy addition to your shelf.</p>
