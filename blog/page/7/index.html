  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Broadmoor/index.php">Broadmoor</a> is another outstanding Audubon sanctuary.  Though to be fair, none of the Audubon properties we&rsquo;ve visited in Massachusetts has disappointed us yet.  Despite sounding like something out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles">The Hounds of the Baskervilles</a>, Broadmoor is situated in a tranquil setting along the bank of the Indian Brook,which flows into the meandering Charles River.  In fact, part of the sanctuary borders the Charles.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/broadmoor/dsc_3665.jpg" alt="Broadmoor" /></p>

<p>Broadmoor comprises of ponds, vernal pools, meadows, tall forests, hillocks, stone bridges, small cascades, and lots of boardwalks.  If you like boardwalks&mdash;who doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;this is for you.  While <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Moose_Hill/index.php">Moose Hill</a> has picturesque boardwalks and <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php">Ipswich</a> has fun boardwalks (including some boardwalk/bridge combo which we&rsquo;d propose be christened &ldquo;boardbridge&rdquo;), Broadmoor&rsquo;s boardwalks expand into wide platforms which give you more room to lounge on while enjoying the spectacular views.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t see many of our avian friends the last time we were there.  But I had a bit of fun with the miniature waterfalls at Mill Pond. The rust-colored water laced with reflections of the blue sky gives it an interesting variegated appearance.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="althalus" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/althalus.jpg" width="186" height="272" />Having plowed through three multi-volume fantasy series in a row, I thought this single-volume tome, the first standalone fantasy adventure by the husband-and-wife team, might be a welcome respite. I haven&rsquo;t read any book by the Eddingses, but their reputation as prolific and popular authors is well-known. I was further intrigued by the &ldquo;#1 international bestseller&rdquo; plug emblazoned on the hardcover.</p>

<p>The title character is a thief and occasional highwayman and murderer whose skills are legendary. He&rsquo;s also a braggart and a liar of epic proportions. Plagued by a streak of uncharacteristic bad luck, he accepts a job from a shady character to steal a Book in the House at the End of the World. He finds the Book but is detained by a talking cat, who is in reality the goddess Dweia in disguise. Dweia persuades him to be her agent, and they recruit others to join their team, including a warrior, a priest, a queen, a mind-reader, and a young thief. Together they engage in epic struggles with agents of the Evil God, who seeks to undo all creation and return the universe to nothingness.</p>

<p>That the names of the authors are in larger fonts than the title of the book should have been a warning bell, I suppose. To be fair, the story is somewhat interesting. The concept of a House that compresses space and time, and that allows one to travel vast distances or time by simply going down the hallway, is a novel idea. Throw in a few modern concepts, such as the time-space duality and even the procedure for rudimentary brain surgery, and the story has a distinct sci-fi feel. Nevertheless, the plot is more or less predictable, straightforward action-adventure with a smattering of romance: Althalus and friends recruit an army, goes here, repel an invasion, fall in love, goes there, fight another war, go some place else, defeat the bad guys, etc. The pace is, for lack of a better word, unchanged. It&rsquo;s the same whether the characters are cuddling or fighting for their lives. The authors seem to be on cruise control throughout; they seem to be recounting a story fact by fact, instead of portraying it, making it come alive. The feeling is comparable to watching a documentary film versus an action movie or drama. The cookie-cutter characters are rather flat and two-dimensional. So they are all different in their attributes and abilities, but nothing else distinguishes one from the other. They all make the same cliche wisecracks, punts, or sarcastic remarks. Some merit a chuckle or two, but after a while one is left to wonder whether or not there is anything else to them. In fact, I can&rsquo;t even envision what each character looks like; I&rsquo;d like to see more than just tall/short, big/tiny, dark-haired/blond, beautiful/ugly, etc. Contrast this with the works of some other authors, such as George Martin, who lavishes attention on the description of the wardrobe alone. Of course, characterization goes beyond superficial appearance. There are other means, such as describing how events unfold from the character&rsquo;s point of view, that can bring the point across. Unfortunately such richness and attention to details are absent here. Similarly, the writing is competent, but lacks a certain sophistication and seriousness demonstrated by some other authors. The book is entertaining if you&rsquo;re in the mood for casual reading, and I feel that it would be most appropriate for a younger audience rather than a serious fantasy fan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="the_halflings_gem" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/the_halflings_gem-178x300.jpg" width="178" height="300" />The end of the second volume leads right into the third. As the companions escaped from Mithral Hall, Regis fell into the clutches of Artemis Entreri, the deadly assassin hired by the leader of the thieves&#8217; guild in Calimport of whom Regis had run afoul. Furthermore, Entreri gained possession of the statuette that conjures the black panther Guenhwyvar, Drizzt&rsquo;s faithful extra-planar companion. Saddened by the loss of Bruenor and now Regis, Drizzt and Wulfgar resolve to track down the assassin to his lair and rescue their friend, while Catti-Brie is grimly determined to finish Bruenor&rsquo;s quest and retake Mithral Hall from the duergars.</p>

<p>After the excitement of volume two, there is a bit of a let-down. After all, the action doesn&rsquo;t really pick up until Drizzt and Wulfgar near the end of their destination. After that, all hell breaks loose, literally. What follows is non-stop action. The party must survive an ambush in the city sewers, find an exit through the trap-filled thieves&#8217; guild, and escape from an an astral plane filled with bloodthirsty demons. All the while, Drizzt is drawn inexorably toward a confrontation with Entreri, who&rsquo;s his equal in every physical aspect and martial skill, yet is his polar opposite in spirit and morality. As expected, Drizzt&rsquo;s duel with Entreri is the highlight of the story, though unfortunately it ends without a resolution. Drizzt&rsquo;s emotional saga continues, as he struggles to be comfortable with his physical appearance, and succeeds in gaining a small measure of acceptance by the nobility of his actions. Yes, the dour ranger may be capable of even love, as the little confession from Catti-Brie seems to indicate. Die-hard Drizzt fans may not want to miss the moment he plants a wet kiss on Catti-Brie&rsquo;s lips, though whether she is aware of it is unclear.</p>

<p>As serious as the story seems, RA Salvatore&rsquo;s naming scheme may need a little more work. Many of the names are original, but some, like Wulfgar, Alustriel, Morkai, etc. come off as a little generic. Drizzt&rsquo;s name for his scimitar, &ldquo;Twinkle&rdquo;, hardly befits a deadly weapon. I hope his nickname for Guenhwyvar isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Pussycat&rdquo;. My last complaint has to do with the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for Mithral Hall. That&rsquo;s just it, there is no battle. I had looked forward to seeing the combined forces of barbarians, dwarves, and wizards rout the despised duergars. Instead, the author seems to have run out of his page quota and only devotes a few brief passages to the party&rsquo;s triumphant return to Mithral Hall. Somewhat disappointing, but I suppose by this time the book will already have fulfilled its purpose.</p>

<p>While this book doesn&rsquo;t quite measure up to Streams of Silver, congratulations for putting this series under your belt. Now you can join Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden in his next exciting adventure, be it in Menzoberranzan or Faerun. If you don&rsquo;t feel intrigued with Drizzt after having read this series, I&rsquo;m a bearded gnome.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="The Crystal Shard" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/The-Crystal-Shard-181x300.jpg" width="181" height="300" />The main problem with works that are inspired by or that borrow from RPG is predictability. After all, what adventure would be complete without a warrior, a rogue, and a sorcerer. Not to mention the party must include a gruff dwarf and a light-hearted, pleasure-loving halfling. The Crystal Shard has got all that and more, but it also brings to life an original in the form of Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden, who&rsquo;s undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved characters in fantasy. That may be the most enduring legacy of this fun if otherwise unremarkable series.</p>

<p>The story is set in the Icewind Dale, a barren, wind-swept region nestled in the armpit of the Spine of the World. Thanks to its remote location, Icewind Dale is largely ignored, until our present story that is, in the lores of the Forgotten Realms, that fabled realm of the vast Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. Icewind Dale is home to Bruenor, a old, curmudgeonly dwarf (who&rsquo;s ever heard of a happy go lucky dwarf?), who fled here after the destruction of his ancestral home, and the halfing Regis, an epicurean who&rsquo;s on the run from some trouble in the south. Befriended to both is Drizzt, a drow-elf ranger on an self-imposed exile from the underground realms of his people. Highly principled and strongly disturbed by the evil and self-serving ways of the drow, he willingly makes his home on the surface world despite the fear and revulsion of almost everyone he comes across. Drizzt&rsquo;s background and emotional complexity makes him a deeper characters than one would expect from a series like this. Rounding out the group are Catti-Brie, a human girl adopted by Bruenor, and Wulfgar, a fierce barbarian warrior taken under Bruenor&rsquo;s tutelage. Trouble brews when Akar Kessell, a bumbling wizard&rsquo;s apprentice, stumbled into possession of Crenshinibon, an almost sentient crystal imbued with vast powers. Aided by the crystal, Kessell assembles a vast army of goblins, orcs and giants to invade Ten Towns and establish himself as the tyrant of Icewind Dale. Drizzt and company must rally the squabbling inhabitants of Ten Towns and gain the help of the hitherto hostile barbarian tribes if everyone is to have a chance.</p>

<p>As transparent as the plot may seem, there are memorable moments such as Drizzt&rsquo;s confrontation with the demon Erttu and Wulfgar&rsquo;s journey to the lair of the ice dragon. This was RA Salvatore&rsquo;s first major work and there are some rough edges here and there. The battle of Bryn Shander somehow lacks the fury and scale of a climactic clash (face it, few are going to be able to outdo the battles of Helm&rsquo;s Deep and the Pelennor Fields). Nevertheless, the author does an excellent job to bring excitement to one-on-one swashbuckling; one can almost envision the blur of Drizzt&rsquo;s dual scimitars or Wulfgar hammering everything into smithereens with mighty Aegis-Fang.</p>

<p>The Crystal Shard has something about each character. While I would have wished for less stereotypical portrayals and a little more depth, it&rsquo;s a satisfactory introduction and launches us immediately into the companions&#8217; even more exciting second adventure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="ArtOfLOTR" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/ArtOfLOTR.jpg" width="185" height="241" />Bringing Tolkien&rsquo;s Middle Earth to life is a monumental task. The locations, creatures and monsters have to be conceptualized, designed and created from the ground up. Capturing the spirit of Tolkien&rsquo;s work is an even more daunting challenge because of its tremendous scope, complexity and beauty. Furthermore, its legions of fans are staunch in their visions of Tolkien&rsquo;s universe, and satisfying all of them is impossible.</p>

<p>That the movie has been a phenomenal success and, more importantly, an incredible realization of Tolkien&rsquo;s visions is a testament to the skills and dedication of Peter Jackson and his team. The most visible aspect of the movie is the artistry underlying the costumes, weapons, architecture, and scenics. Jackson&rsquo;s most far-reaching impact was perhaps his decision to bring in two of the most influential Tolkien artists, Alan Lee and John Howe, as art directors. Both have illustrated Tolkien for a long time and in many cases their works have become widely accepted if not standard interpretations of Tolkien. The artists and their talented teams are responsible for virtually every element of the movie. Indeed, the production designs have the look and feel of works of art. The most direct result is the movie&rsquo;s breathtaking beauty, which exceeds even the most fertile imagination among Tolkien fans. A secondary result is the harmony and consistency of artistic elements and designs from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The book is a comprehensive chronicle of the art of the movie. Its 192 pages are lavishly illustrated with lush color photographs and gorgeous drawings and paintings. The book is divided into four main chapters: Locations, Costumes, Armory, and Creatures.</p>

<p>The Locations chapter is further divided into sections that correspond to major locations. These are Bag End, Bree, Weathertop, Isengard, Rivendell, The Misty Mountains, Lothlorien, Anduin, and Amon Hen. I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare in stupefied silence at the paradise-like beauty of Rivendell or the alien grace and intricacy of Lothlorien. This section alone is worth the price of the book. The architectural pencil drawings are outstanding. Many excellent designs were created even though only a few eventually made it into the movie. If, like me, you get goose bumps when the camera sweeps through the hall of Dwarrowdelf, know that it&rsquo;s no coincidence.</p>

<p>The costume and armory designs are most conspicuous for their painstaking details. Each costume is unique and manages to evoke the characteristics of each race. Thus hobbits look like townspeople out for a stroll, human tunics are rugged and martial, dwarven armor exudes fine craftsmanship, and the flowing robes of the elves accentuate their delicate features and natural grace. The weapon designs follow the same line and display remarkable details. Sauron&rsquo;s various armor designs are my favorite.</p>

<p>The Creatures chapter shows drawings, composites, maquettes, and sculptures of the various Orc races, the Uruk-Hais, the troll, the Watcher, the Ringwraiths, and the Balrog. The design of the Watcher illustrates the high artistic standard of the designers. Tolkien never described the Watcher in details, so many outstanding designs were considered and rejected before one was finally selected. Of all the creatures that stalk, crawl and fly in the movie, perhaps the Balrog is the most awe-inspiring. The Balrog is another creature that Tolkien only briefly described. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the various interpretations, from reptilian to winged humanoids to centaur-like. The end result of all this is one of the most awesome monsters on the silver screen.</p>

<p>This treasure trove of artwork is a must-have not only for Tolkien lovers and fans of the movie but also for those who appreciate great fantasy art.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Streams_of_Silver" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Streams_of_Silver-182x300.jpg" width="182" height="300" />Good things come in trilogies and, in most cases, the second of the series is the best&hellip;Streams of Silver is perhaps the zenith of the Icewind Dale trilogy. There are plenty of exciting adventures, desperate battles, horrifying monsters, devious sorcerers, dark dungeons, but most importantly, there is an element of the unknown. In the first novel, we all know the identity of the villain and what his nefarious plans are. Here, the companions, and the readers, have no idea what to expect, what horrible discovery they will make once they reach their destination. However, this book is more than just swashbuckling and dungeon exploring. We gain an insight into the mind of Drizzt, the mental conflicts and emotional sacrifices he must endure to uphold his principles. Even though there isn&rsquo;t a neatly wrapped conclusion by the end, this book is proof that sometimes the journey is better than the destination!</p>

<p>The series continues with Bruenor, Wulfgar, Drizzt and Regis embarking on a quest to discover the doom that befell Bruenor&rsquo;s ancestral home, Mithral Hall. Many difficulties face the companions, not the least of which is the dwarf&rsquo;s inability to recollect even the approximate location of this underground kingdom, where precious mithril is so abundant that it flows in streams along the walls. Regis, on the other hand, is pursued by a deadly bounty-hunter intent on collecting his gem, and his head. The companions also attract the attention of a devious wizard of the Hosttower of the Arcane Brotherhood for their previous involvement with the crystal Crenshinibon. Along the way, the companions must deal with hordes of monsters, including trolls, ghostly unicorn, giant worm, bog monsters, even a banshee, but yet the assassin and his cohorts are ever their greatest threat. Once they rediscover Mithral Hall, they must be prepared to face its terrifying secret.</p>

<p>Of course, the essence and the main attraction of Dungeons &amp; Dragons are the dungeons themselves, where rich treasures await discovery and monsters may lurk around every corner. For me, the most exciting part of the Lord of the Rings, indeed of any fantasy, is Moria. There is much of Moria here. There is the central plot that the dwarves had delved too deep and unwittingly released a dormant horror. Then there is the companions&#8217; effort to solve a puzzle to open a hidden door and gain the entrance to the underground passage, and the climactic confrontation at a bridge over a chasm which leads to the exit from the mines. This is perhaps RA Salvatore&rsquo;s nod to his inspiration (he admitted that reading Tolkien had led to his interest in the genre). Nevertheless, there are much that are original here, and the plot is seldom predictable.</p>

<p>Of interest is the exploration of Drizzt&rsquo;s emotional depths. That he has refuted the ways of his people is clear, but here we also get to appreciate the emotional cost of his decision. There would come a time when the pain of his rejection by the surface world because of his dark elf heritage becomes unbearable. As Drizzt struggles to reconcile with his decision, he will need to draw on the support of his friends and on an unlikely source. Bruenor&rsquo;s conflict is also highlighted. All his life he has longed to return to the home of his childhood, of which he is the rightful king, yet he may need to realize that his true home belongs with the friends he has made.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an exciting buddy road adventure with strong character development that makes it much more well-rounded than it otherwise would be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="rhapsody_child_of_blood" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/rhapsody_child_of_blood-180x300.jpg" width="180" height="300" />I was attracted to Rhapsody, the first book of the Rhapsody trilogy, by way of its critical acclaim as one of the best fantasy debut in years. The book does not disappoint. It&rsquo;s a marvellously executed masterpiece of high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien that we all know and love. The characters are original and wonderfully appealing, the setting at once exotic and beautiful. Elizabeth Haydon brings to life a rarity in modern fantasy fiction: a female protagonist. In Rhapsody, the eponymous heroine is a young woman, half-human, half-Lirin (something akin to an elven race), a musician, singer, and Namer, the latter being a practioner of an art that allows her to create magic by invoking qualities associated with the name of someone or something. Being on the run from villains, she unwittingly enlists the help of two mysterious characters: a hideous, deadly assassin and a monstrous, wisecracking military sergeant. Both are themselves fugitives from an ancient, omnipotent evil. Together they embark on a long journey through the center of the world, and find themselves in a strange new land, in a time that may have been centuries removed from their own. With all that they have ever known long gone, they must struggle to explore their new world and combat a horror that may have followed them from the old world. Tied into all of this is the fate of two young lovers who are brought together for the briefest moments before being flung centuries apart.</p>

<p>Haydon portrays a heroine that is immediately likeable and sympathetic. She is vulnerable yet strong, innocent yet wise, naive yet experienced, gentle yet hardened. Her fierce independence, touched with a fiery temper, is balanced only by her boundless compassion and sense of justice. Unlike many other heroes, aside from her innate ability as a Namer who can perform magic with her voice and her music, she doesn&rsquo;t possess any other superhuman power. Even her skills have to be painstakingly learned and constantly practiced. She comes to master the use of the sword, but as the result of training, not inborn ability. This is a refreshing change from the Richard Rahl-stereotype who is given a magic sword and almost immediate gains the skills contained within it. The other two protagonists complement the heroine perfectly, and each has his own history and contribute significantly to the plot. The half-monstrous, possibly cannibalistic, sergeant is apt to dish out humorous one-liners, contrary to his fearsome appearance. The harsh, cruel assassin may yet learn to like and love Rhapsody as one of his own family. As the story progresses, the readers immerse in the intertwining lives of the three main characters and grow with them as they grow, until their peculiar relationship no longer seems strange but familiar and intimate.</p>

<p>Haydon has masterful command of the pen. Her prose is beautifully rendered; I often find myself going back over many a passage to fully relish and appreciate all of her words. She revels in bringing out details and manages to evoke not only sights but also sounds, somehow making them feel alive as if they could float out of the page. Her world is exotic, populated both strange and familiar races, creatures, and personae, brought to life with meticulous details. Her descriptive prose makes use of many modern scientific and technical elements, such as the description of nature of music and that of the physiology of a certain character. She bring to life many fantastic adventures. The passage through the center of the world is hardly a new concept, yet made startlingly so by very original ideas: the giant roots, the cleansing fire, the unimaginable horror dormant within. And of course, the ancient mountain realm of Canrif hasn&rsquo;t produced such breathless anticipation in me since the Fellowship entered Moria.</p>

<p>The pacing of the book is steady. There is indeed a climax at the end, but along the way Haydon sprinkles enough revelations to keep the reader enthralled. There is seldom a boring moment when you wish the author would just get on to the next point. Even when the pace seems to slow, the dialogues are a joy to read. Instead of being space fillers, the sometimes acerbic, oftentimes witty, always razor-sharp verbal repartees are a feast for the eyes. Rhapsody in particular, has a tremendous wit, and a sly humor that rivals that of her monstrous friend. Their verbal exchanges do a great deal to lighten the mood and speed the story along.</p>

<p>If any complaint can be found, it would be with certain characterization of the heroine. Surely, her femininity offers her certain unique advantages over her traditional male counterparts. For one thing, she usually gets overlooked as the underdog at the start of a fight; many an opponent would come to regret the mistake, if he lives through it. Secondly, however unwittingly, she is able to attract and seduce male characters simply with her appearance. This comes into play often as Rhapsody is possessive of a stunning, perfect beauty. In retrospect, I was wrong to have said she is blessed with no inborn gift. Rhapsody&rsquo;s beauty and its effect on men indeed prove powerful enough and significant enough to drive many major plot points. It&rsquo;s just too convenient and detracts from her other positive qualities. Perhaps, as an offset to this unfair advantage, Rhapsody is blissfully oblivious of her own beauty, stubbornly believing instead that men happen to stare at her because of her racially mixed&mdash;thus freakish and alien&mdash;appearance. This self-delusion is kept up for the whole book and into the next! Given her astute power of observation, it would be hard to believe such inanity, which can only be ascribed to either extreme naïveté or plain stupidity.</p>

<p>The other complaint I had, albeit only a minor one, is the speed with which the assassin character is able to build a powerful, sophisticated civilization from scattered tribes of a primitive people. In contrast, in Robert Jordan&rsquo;s universe, it took the hero the whole book and more to do more or less the same (on the other hand, as of now Jordan&rsquo;s series is also 10 books and counting, with the end nowhere in sight). Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t so much a weakness as a stretch in the mantle of believability, but this hardly detracts from the enjoyment of the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="JohnShawNaturePhotographyFieldGuide" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/JohnShawNaturePhotographyFieldGuide.jpg" width="166" height="220" />The burning question in my mind as I look at a stunning photo in a calendar, postcard, or coffee-table book is &ldquo;How did they do it?&rdquo; There are just certain details about a photo that stand out and scream &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. Many photography guidebooks tend to fall into two camps: those are little more than glorified list of equipment you likely wouldn&rsquo;t ever buy or be able to afford, and those that are a showcase for the photographer to expound on his experience and philosophy. This book, by well-known landscape and wildlife photographer John Shaw, will tell you exactly how <em>he</em> did it. In clear and concise prose, he explains in details his system for getting the exposure you want (as distinguished from simply determining the correct exposure). While this may not be earth-shattering or even entirely novel, its simplicity and ease of use will make you wonder why you didn&rsquo;t think of it before. It obviously works beautifully for Shaw. For me, this was the single most useful thing I got out of the book.</p>

<p>The rest of the book is geared more toward the beginning photographer with extensive coverage of basic principles of exposure, lens selection, composition, flash photography, etc. There is a surprisingly large section on close-ups, usually not the most well expounded topic in a general photography book. There are some advices on field gear and locations that a veteran photographer may find useful. Shaw does cover enough gear (mostly Nikon) to keep an equipment junkie happy. In all, true to the book&rsquo;s title as a &ldquo;field guide&rdquo;, the predominant theme is practicality, and you can actually put many of his suggestions to good use right away. Lastly, the book also has enough beautiful photos to be an impressive coffee table book.</p>

<p>I find Shaw&rsquo;s prose to be efficient and direct, not condescending or ingratiating as how-to books tend to get. The book is logically organized and compartmental; you will not have to read cover to cover to benefit from it. If you&rsquo;re interested in nature photography, this book would be a worthy addition to your shelf.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="icewind_dale_II" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/icewind_dale_II-250x300.jpg" width="250" height="300" />In a world populated with excellent RPG games, IWD2 stands out for its solid foundation of compelling story line, great game play, and high replayability. It&rsquo;s hard to please all RPG fans who desire different mixes of action, quest, and character development. IWD2 strikes a nice balance between quest-laden Baldur&rsquo;s Gate and Diablo&rsquo;s mindless click-fest. There are plenty of hack and slash to be found here, including all-out melees with a multitude of foes and harrowing battles against powerful monsters. While many quests are of the simple &ldquo;go there and fetch this&rdquo; variety, many are quite lengthy and challenging. But the most compelling raison d&#8217;être for IWD2 has to be its implementation of the vastly improved AD&amp;D 3rd Edition rule set. The 3rd Edition offers not only new races and sub-races, but also new classes, skills, rules, feats, and weapons. The new races, coupled with multi-classing, make possible a mind-boggling number of party combinations, from Drow paladins/sorcerers to deep gnome thief/monks. A vast selection of weapons and magical items can be found throughout the game. Even better, the special Heart of Fury mode with insanely challenging combat and vastly upgraded weapons is almost another game within a game. Throw in an almost intuitively perfect user interface and beautifully rendered, finely polished graphics and there&rsquo;s no doubt IWD2 is a winner in the crowded RPG arena.</p>

<p>IWD2 is set 30 years after the events in the original Icewind Dale, when a band of adventurers issued from Easthaven to thwart the plan of a demon to turn the Spine of the World into his private playground. Many of the characters from the original Icewind Dale, in some cases now grown up, make cameo appearances. In fact, the antagonists in the present story have an intimate connection to certain characters in the original story. It&rsquo;s not necessary to have played Icewind Dale, but if you have, you&rsquo;ll certainly appreciate the connections.</p>

<p>As its name implies, IWD2 is a visit to that famous region in the fabled Forgotten Realms of the AD&amp;D universe. The story begins when goblin hordes invaded the Ten-Towns, one of which had already been overrun. Bands of mercenaries, of which you are a part, were summoned to the defense of the town Targos, the goblins&#8217; next target. Almost as soon as you get to town, you have to deal with goblin attacks. Soon it becomes apparent that greater evils were behind the goblin threat and you found yourself thrust to the forefront of the conflict, for gold or for glory. Your adventure takes you through many exotic locales, both above- and under-ground, including visits to the great oak of Kuldahar, the warrens of Dragon&rsquo;s Eye, the steaming jungles of Chult, and the ruined elven fortress Severed Hand. The plot is fairly linear; you won&rsquo;t be going back and forth between locales to accomplish quests. Nevertheless, the game is surprisingly replayable, thanks to the reasons below.</p>

<p>The new rules are vast improvements for several reasons. Gone are the cryptic THAC0, the counter-intuitive negative armor rating, and the rather complicated types of saving throws. Now, armor bonuses are additive; however, as before, wearing armor increases arcane spell failures and hinders certain abilities such as Hide and Move Silently. Saving throws are reduced to 3 types: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will, which are directly affected by your ability ratings, racial bonuses and magical enhancements. You get to allocate points among a bevy of new skills, such as Bluff and Diplomacy, and feats, such as Ambidexterity and Two-weapon fighting (fighters rejoice!) I&rsquo;m almost giddy with excitement whenever my characters get to upgrade. New races include half-orcs, Aasimar and Tiefling humans, Duergar dwarves, Drow elves (yes!), and Deep-Gnomes. Each race comes with its own bonuses and disadvantages; some are more powerful than others, but advance in levels more slowly. New classes include monks, barbarians, and sorcerers. If you&rsquo;re a fan of RA Salvatore, you can even re-create his party of dwarf, Drow, halfling, human, and barbarian from the Icewind Dale trilogy. With multi-classing you can get a dizzying array of combinations, such as monk/sorcerer, paladin/cleric, or thief/ranger/fighter. The experience level now caps at 30, allowing the creation of even more powerful multi-classed characters. In fact, experimenting with different party combinations is half of the fun, and playing the game again with a new party is almost as fun as playing a new game! Unlike many other game, you get to create your entire party from scratch. For those so inclined, you can use one of the pre-packaged parties. Of course, you can also import characters from previous runs through the game. Unfortunately, due to the new AD&amp;D implementation, you can&rsquo;t import characters from the original Icewind Dale. Exotic and highly desirable magical items are sprinkled throughout the game. In typical Icewind Dale fashion, they are either picked up in quests or available at stores instead of made. A vast many more non-essential but cool items can only be picked up through cheat codes. A few new items such as bags of holdings, gem bags and scroll cases are so indispensable that it&rsquo;s a surprise they weren&rsquo;t thought of in the original game.</p>

<p>The battles in IWD2 are intense and furious. For some reason, the designers tend to favor the &ldquo;attack as soon as party moves to a new area&rdquo; approach. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that except after a long journey most of your defensive spells will have worn off. The result is often a frantic scramble to escape damage, cast defensive spells, summon supports, and finally counter attack. Combat almost certainly requires a tactical approach, as the enemy parties more often than not are well-balanced, complete with both tankers and magic users. Yes, many times enemies will also teleport in behind your back when the battle rages hottest. It&rsquo;s hardly fair from the player&rsquo;s perspective, but I suppose it could happen if this were real-life. The AI is also excellent. Enemies will often go for the weakest member of my party, much to my chagrin. When attacked, enemies will cast the appropriate defensive spells; for instance, if attacked with fire arrows, enemy mages would cast Protection from Arrows and Protection from Fire. Sometimes, however, they will also mindlessly attack an invincible target. One of my favorite strategies is to lure enemies into attacking a summon, then encase the lure in an impervious shell and let my mages bombard them to smithereens from a safe distance away. In short, you can&rsquo;t rush in hacking and slashing and expect to last; the enemies are just too powerful for a single-minded approach. This also necessitates making up a balanced party; you can probably get by with a party of all-fighters or all-sorcerers, but would certainly have a much more difficult time.</p>

<p>The Heart of Fury mode deserves an special mention. This mode can only be accessed from the configuration screen, and a dialog box would pop up to warn you of the implications. Anyways, you shouldn&rsquo;t even be playing in this mode with characters lower than level-15. Heart of Fury mode, in short, stands for insane difficulty. Not only are monsters more numerous than in normal mode, they also are immensely powerful and have astronomical attack and damage ratings. If you&rsquo;re not careful, even fully-upgraded level-30 characters can get mauled in a hurry. Your rewards are proportionately powerful magical items, including a special magic sword that are +10 when everything else maxes out at +5, and more experience points. Of course, the challenge is its own reward. You probably won&rsquo;t get the most out of the game unless you play through and finish the game in this mode.</p>

<p>Much ado has been made about the game&rsquo;s venerable but dated Bioware Infinity Engine. What it lacks in 3-D camera angles it makes up for in polish and ease of use. Despite its popularity, I just find Neverwinter Nights&#8217; interface clunky, and the constant need to pan and zoom tires my wrist and frazzles my nerves. IWD2&rsquo;s interface is much more intuitive than those of IWD and Baldur&rsquo;s Gate and does a great job of organizing the wealth of information required to effectively manage an RPG party while leaving as much space as possible for the god&rsquo;s-eye view. The columns of buttons and character portraits on the sides of the screen are now moved to the bottom right, freeing up a big chunk of screen estate (chances are you&rsquo;d be using hot keys instead of clicking anyways). The quick-action bar is fully configurable and a joy to use. I only wish more slots were made available for frequently used spells, perhaps with the use of the shift and control keys. The maps are not very large, but this is a blessing in disguise. It takes a lot of time to move from one point to the next, and the less time you spend moving is the more time you spend actually playing the game. Complaints have been made about the game&rsquo;s lackluster graphics and animations. In fact, the fixed 2-D background is gorgeous. And I found the sprites and spell effects animations to be beautifully rendered, particularly in true-color mode; they&rsquo;re certainly superior to those in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate II. The spell animations are a joy to behold; it makes spellcasting fun for everybody (except for the monsters on the receiving end). In an aside, the soundtrack is superb, from the haunting strains in Targos to the exotic Eastern influence of Limha&rsquo;s theme. Characters are also given a large selection of voices, including Drow-speak! The voiceover is competent, if sometimes overwrought. There are no famous names from Hollywood, but I recognize minor actors from &ldquo;Armageddon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Speed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Thanks to its implementation of new AD&amp;D rules and its excellent game play and interface, IWD2 deserves to be a standout in the crowd.</p>

After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters. Sadness is a powerful emotion, and the ending features one of the most emotionally moving scenes I can recall since Tolkien. Yet there is beauty in tragedy, and having known the ending, I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>As DoWN begins, the refugees from Pax Tharkas have found a temporary home, albeit one ill-suited for them, in the kingdom of the mountain dwarves. The companions prepare to embark on their next quest, to the ancient great city Tarsis the Beautiful, in search of a better refuge. Little do they know that evil forces are already following their tracks and laying a trap for them. Events in Tarsis would force the companions to split into two groups, each searching for an ancient artifact that allows the wielder to exert control over dragons. Their adventures would take them to distant lands, fraught with dark mystery and danger. Some of the companions will have grown in power, some in knowledge, some in maturity, and some would find love along the way. In a sense, the wide-eyed innocence of the first volume has worn off. As the characters gain experience, their worries and sorrows also increase. Laurana is a case in point. She has changed greatly since leaving Qualinost. No longer the happy elfmaiden innocent to the ways of the world, she has become more and more like Tanis, wiser yet weighed down with care and sadness.</p>

<p>Tanis would encounter a figure from the past that would prove to be his greatest temptation thus far and force him to reconsider his beliefs and loyalty in a whole new light.</p>

<p>Despite the prevailing depressive mood, there are many light moments. My favorite character, Tas, is as funny as ever and is given more screen time than before. While the focus has been taken off some characters such as Goldmoon and Riverwind, Tas would shoulder more responsiblities and even makes a few crucial discoveries, unwittingly of course.</p>

<p>In light of its gripping storyline and powerful emotional undercurrents, it would not be unfair to characterize DoWN as a fantasy masterpiece.</p>
