  <div class="entry-content"><p>Canon&rsquo;s S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots. Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous. The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use. Lastly, it&rsquo;s a great deal considering its price-feature ratio.</p>

<p>The S30 includes the usual automatic presets such as landscape and portrait, but also offers the semi-automatic and fully manual modes that a serious photographer would want. The following adjustments may come in handy: 1) film speed from ASA-equivalent 50 to 800, 2) spot, center-weighted and evaluative metering modes, 3) three selectable autofocus areas, 4) exposure compensation between -2 and 2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV, 5) continuous drive mode (though maxing out at a modest 2.5fps), 6) macro mode. While I still prefer an SLR in most situations, the S30 fills many of my needs very nicely. I use the it to take preview or experimental shots or to take shots that I would hesitate to blow film on. Morever, the S30 makes your job a cinch when it comes to panoramas. The panoramic mode shows you a third of the previous frame, either vertical or horizontal, which is an invaluable guide to help you line up the current frame. I used to have to spend a lot of time in Photoshop to line up adjacent frames and erase the seams between frames. Canon&rsquo;s Photostitch software does all of that and more, at the click of a button!</p>

<p>Picture quality is very good, with excellent sharpness throughout the image and no noticeable softness in the corners at wide-angle. Macro shots are very sharp, to the point that I decided to do close-ups primarily with the S30. Colors can be a little flat, but this can be easily fixed in Photoshop. There is a special &ldquo;Vivid&rdquo; or saturated mode, but this comes at the expense of losing other controls over the shot. I&rsquo;ve noticed that the dynamic range for the CCD sensor is quite low, much worse than for color negatives or slides. This is most apparent if you&rsquo;ve got a mixed light and dark scene; either the sky would be washed out or the foreground would be underexposed. This could be a shortcoming of CCDs in general and not one particular to the S30.</p>

<p>The S30&rsquo;s 3-megapixels resolution is good enough for a 2048x1536 image, which in turn is sufficient for 8x10 enlargements. If this is not large enough for your needs, the S40 ups the ante to 4 megapixels. There is a USB jack for downloading images and an A/V jack for previewing images on TV. You will want to invest in a CF card-reader however, for convenience&rsquo;s sake. The storage slot takes Type I or II CF cards, and also accommodates a Microdrive.</p>

<p>The S30&rsquo;s compact size is its greatest asset, but is also responsible for a few shortcomings. The 1.8&#8221; LCD screen is bright and contrasty, but only indoors. Lacking a swivel and anti-glare coating, it&rsquo;s virtually useless outdoors. You may have to resort to the optical viewfinder, which does not cover 100 percent of the image. The LCD displays most useful information, but inexplicably lacks a battery life indicator. You&rsquo;d have no idea how much power is left until the low-battery indicator flashes. To make matters worse, the rechargeable Li-Ion battery has rather short lifespan, between 30-50 shots. I have to carry 2 spare batteries in order to shoot for a whole day. The thumb-operated directional controller is rather awkward to use. You scroll to move up/down and press to move left/right. To select, you have to press down on the middle. In my case, to hit select, I had to learn a way to press it just right, otherwise the controller would move left or right instead. Lastly, while this may not matter much to most people, I frequently use a tripod, which blocks the battery cover and makes changing battery quite a hassle.</p>

<p>Despite its shortcomings, I&rsquo;ve found the S30 to be an indispensable companion. I&rsquo;ve had it for almost a year and taken it with me on trips to Asia and throughout western North America. At times I yearned for a more advanced camera like the Canon G2 or even a digital SLR, but more often than not I found myself thankful that I was able to take pictures I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken otherwise with a larger camera. The S30 has more than paid for itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="The_Pillars_of_Creation" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/The_Pillars_of_Creation-197x300.jpg" width="197" height="300" />Pillars of Creation follows the adventures of a young woman, Jennsen, illegitimate daughter of Darken Rahl, as she travels the world in search of escape and vengeance. She is aided by a spy of the Imperial Order who may be more than he appears to be. At the same time, Jennsen&rsquo;s unique ability may mean the end of all life, if she and Richard don&rsquo;t discover the truth in time.</p>

<p>Many reviewers have lamented the departure from the main plot line. True enough, the storyline here has little to do with the last installment, with the Midlands war and Richard&rsquo;s liberation of Altur&#8217;Rang. However, there are enough materials to advance some aspects of the story, notably the whereabouts of Nathan and the Imperial Order&rsquo;s attack on Aydindril. We also learn a great deal about the hitherto mostly unknown land of D&#8217;Hara and its people under the rule of the new Lord Rahl. This installment expands the Sword of Truth universe while introducing a character who may prove to be essential later in the series.</p>

<p>The writing is impeccable. I think Goodkind has gone a long way from the first book. My main complaint has to do with his pacing. As he has done in some previous installments, the story plods along until it builds up into a climax in the last few chapters. Much of the story helps to build the characters, and characterization is something Goodkind is very good at, but he tends to overdo it sometimes. Goodkind brings to life a very sympathetic character in Jennsen, but he also creates some remarkably revulsive and twisted characters, and readers are forced to bear with these rather one-dimensional creatures to the point of exasperation. In Goodkind&rsquo;s fashion, the climax tends to come in a frantic rush, with characters converging and clashing in an all-or-nothing melee. In this one, though, the end seems to be too sitcom-like and neatly wrapped for my taste. At the same time, it leaves out enough details to leave me somewhat unsatisfied, such as what the &ldquo;pillars of creation&rdquo; have to do with anything or why Richard and company happens to be travelling to a wasteland in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of these questions will be addressed in the next installment, but then again, perhaps not. The only thing certain is that we&rsquo;ll have to wait six months to find out. But I suppose such is the lot for fans of epic fantasy.</p>

<p>My ranking of the series so far is as follows:</p>

<p>Book IV: Temple of the Winds
Book III: Blood of the Fold
Book VI: Faith of the Fallen
Book II: Stone of Tears
Book I: Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule
Book VII: Pillars of Creation
Book V: Soul of the Fire</p>

In Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule, Goodkind&rsquo;s writing just didn&rsquo;t seem to possess a certain sophistication and polish, and at times it had such a wooden quality that I found myself squirming. Now after having read through the 5th book of the series, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve stuck around! As the tale progresses, so does the author&rsquo;s mastery of his craft. Now I find myself swallowing up every word. This book is my favorite of the series. It has all the adventures and mysteries of the previous volumes, at the same time has a surprising emotional edge, not only between the main characters but between some secondary characters as well. Richard and Kahlan will have to face their most severe trial thus far, and it wasn&rsquo;t a result of them doing something annoyingly stupid like running off alone into unknown danger. All the twists and turns building up to the climax will glue your eyes to the pages. The last 100 pages or so are as masterfully executed as any. Even if the previous volumes have taught you to expect the unexpected, the unmasking of the villain may yet surprise some. Goodkind&rsquo;s handling and manipulating of story threads are perhaps his greatest asset. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m somewhat dismayed at his penchant for killing off characters, even those he had painstakingly portrayed, by the end of the story.</p>

<p>This book is perhaps the pinnacle of the series; the subsequent volumes just don&rsquo;t come close to matching its thrills and excitement. Expect many a sleepless night once you pick this one up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Soul_of_the_Fire" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Soul_of_the_Fire-201x300.jpg" width="201" height="300" />This book is perhaps a let-down from the enthralling Temple of the Winds. The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?) and their endless plotting and machinations. Perhaps because I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t care much for politics, I find most of the plot borderline dull. Even the climax seems rushed, being resolved in about 15 pages or so, and leaves many loose ends. Perhaps most annoyingly, the main characters go out and put themselves in danger needlessly and trivially; knowing that things would be tied together somehow in the end doesn&rsquo;t make it any less annoying. The emotional veins that make the previous volumes so endearing are conspicuously absent here; there are few sympathetic characters to latch on to, to exhort. The only thrills I had with this book have to do with Cara&rsquo;s adventures, few though they are. This volume is the weakest in the series thus far. I can only hope number 6 will be better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Faith_of_the_Fallen" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Faith_of_the_Fallen-201x300.jpg" width="201" height="300" />Faith of the Fallen picks up where Soul of the Fire left off. It follows several characters while advancing the main storyline. The climax, which brings together major threads in the story, is done in the typical Goodkind fashion, action-filled and satisfying. On the flip side, with this and the previous installment, Goodkind seems to have departed from the usual sword- and sorcery-oriented storytelling. Sure, there are intense battles to whet our appetites, but the principal focus of the book was on the nature of human character and society. As such, while we follow Richard and Nicci&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventures&rdquo; in the Old World, perhaps it can&rsquo;t be help that the pace is plodding and the tone annoyingly didactic. Yes, the Order believes that man is inherently evil, yes, those with ability must help those without for the common good, yes, the Order brings equality to all; the point is made, but must it be repeated every chapter by every character? At times, the book reads like &ldquo;1984&rdquo; in the Middle Ages. And at times, the book stretches the limit of believability: that the Order is able to dominate a vast society with mind-numbing single-mindedness and unsophisticated fanaticism, that the great wizard and leader Richard would so easily give in to his fate even though he has faced much worse odds before, that in the end a work of art is able to convert the masses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not happy with the way some characters are handled, or not handled at all. Nothing is mentioned of the major Ander characters from Soul of the Fire, nor of Nathan; Ann appears at the beginning and resurfaced at the end, her role adding nothing to the story; nothing comes up of Ulicia and the other Sisters of the Dark; albeit they&rsquo;re minor characters, the way Harold and Cyrilla turned out are rather uncharacteristic. And, as he has done in the past, Goodkind terminate some important and sympathetic characters rather abruptly; it isn&rsquo;t disappointing that they disappear, but that in doing so they don&rsquo;t affect the plot at all. While, at long last, the vast D&#8217;Haran and Imperial Order armies clash, the description of the battles lack the scale, the fury, and the visceral excitement seen in the works of others like Robert Jordan. All of that said, Goodkind brought to life a remarkable character, Nicci, who is probably the most complex, conflicted and dramatic character in the series.</p>

<p>This book is a good read, but I yearn for the thrills and the sense of wonder of the previous installments that are conspicuously absent here.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-07T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 7<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="baldurs_gate_2" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/baldurs_gate_2.jpg" width="196" height="257" />The Baldur&rsquo;s Gate franchise is the most popular single-player RPG series out there for good reasons, even though it&rsquo;s been a few years since its release. While more recent Black Isle games, notably Icewind Dale II, have vastly improved graphics and interface and others like Neverwinter Nights have changed the playing field entirely, BGII stands out for its tremendous scope and exceptional depth. BGII&rsquo;s complexity, intertwining subplots and host of myriad characters are enough to constitute a novel, one which you get to shape and play out instead of merely reading. To me that&rsquo;s the essence of RPG that few others have been able to capture. Reinforcing this feeling, at many points in the game you must make decisions that have far-reaching consequences. Furthermore, you can also complete many quests using the good or evil approach. You may decide how to proceed based on whether you want to be good or evil; there are non-player characters (NPCs) of both alignments ready to assist you.</p>

<p>BGII&rsquo;s strongest asset is its quests. While some quests are short and easily completed, most are substantial, highly interesting, and many engender their own sub-quests. For instance, one quest requires you to infiltrate a thieves guild suspected of treason; to gain their trust, you must finish several tasks for them; after you gather evidence of their treason, you&rsquo;re asked to go back and eliminate the guild leader; if you&rsquo;re successful, you then have the option of becoming the new leader and manage your own guild. It&rsquo;s possible to finish the game doing only the minimum handful of quests, but you&rsquo;d be missing a big part of the game. Similarly, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to complete all quests in one run, because the quests you get depend on the decisions you make. For instance, you can side either with the thieves&#8217; guild or the rival vampires&#8217; guild, each of which comes with its own storyline and quests. Most of the quests are initiated at the beginning of the game in Athkatla. Subsequently, quests become smaller and more linear.</p>

<p>Characters are tightly intertwined with quests. Since you start off with only one player, you should add additional characters to your party. Characters range from elven cleric/wizard to human ranger/stalker. Some are carry-overs from BG1. Some are found only if you accept certain quests, and some come with their own quests. You can interact with virtually any character in the game. Each character has his/her own history, alignment, and personality. From time to time, characters in your party will initiate dialogues with you and with one another, most with some amount of actual voice dialogue. Some interactions are quite funny; I&rsquo;ve chuckled many times with Minsc and Jan in my party. One feature that I suspect to be very popular is romance with characters in your party. If you meet certain conditions, a male player can romance with one of three female NPCs and a female player can romance with one male NPC. Romance are simply additional dialogues that you go through during lulls between battles. They don&rsquo;t add significantly to the plot, but they&rsquo;re an extra dimension that adults may appreciate.</p>

<p>A new feature in BGII is the &ldquo;stronghold&rdquo;. The stronghold you get depends on your class. For instance, the fighter stronghold is a keep outside of Athkatla, while the thieves stronghold is a guild headquarter in the Docks district. Strongholds are gained after you complete a certain quest; they generate gold for your coffers and come with their own mini-quests at intervals. They&rsquo;re not essential to the story, but they add immensely to the illusion of role-playing. Another great new feature is familiars, small pet-like creatures that follow you and obey your orders. There are many tricks you can do with familiars, but mostly they&rsquo;re just cool to have.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played BG1, the premise is that you&rsquo;re the illegitimate child of Bhaal, the God of Murder. After you defeated your nemesis at the end of BG1, your party was ambushed and taken prisoner. You wake up in a dark dungeon and find yourself tortured and apparently experimented upon by an unknown wizard. The game begins as the dungeon are invaded by hooded assailants and you are released. Now you must fight your way out of the dungeons and discover the identity of your captor and thwart his nefarious plan. You will explore the vast city Athkatla as well as travel to many exotic destinations such as an extra-planar prison, an underwater Sahuagin city, the Underdark, the elven city Suldanessellar, even the Nine Hells! There are innumerable dungeons and ruins along the way for your to explore. If any game is able to truly capture the dungeon exploring feel of D&amp;D, this is it!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll encounter a virtual encyclopedic list of monsters, including golems, vampires, liches, beholders, mind-flayers, werewolves, demons, and dragons. Some are immensely powerful and require much tactical planning on your part. Mastering spells and understanding their effects and limitations are a must. This is a hard task as there are 300 spells of all types in the game. Enemy spellcasters have powerful magical protections that make them virtually invincible. However, every protection spell has some form of counter. To successfully attack them, you must use the appropriate counter-spells to weaken their defense. Game play is fast and furious. Battles are not as large as those in IWD2 and are more oriented toward magical duelling, which is equally if not more fun.</p>

<p>The sprite graphics and animations are unspectacular by modern standards, but they are no longer noticeable once you become immersed in the game. Background graphics is gorgeous eye-candy, however, particularly the Sahuagin city, the Underdark, and Suldanessellar. The soundtrack and voice-over work are superb.</p>

<p>BGII has very high-replay value thanks to its breadth and richness. If you like RPG games, this one is a must-have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="AStormOfSwords" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/AStormOfSwords.jpg" width="200" height="290" />With this third hit in a row, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon. Just when you think things can&rsquo;t get any better, Martin turns out another gem. Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting. I can only hope that this series doesn&rsquo;t turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.</p>

<p>Elements that make the first two book great are all here: tightly crafted narratives, convincing and memorable characters, realistic dialogues, exotic locales, and intriguing plots. Martin continues to make bold strokes which are completely unexpected. He introduces the point-of-view of Jaime Lannister for the first time. The Kingslayer turns out to be a far more complex character than his reputation thus far may indicate. More than ever before, readers will be completely unsure whom to root for. Martin goes on to eliminate a major character who had appeared certain to survive the series. This may come as a complete shock to many, even to those who have come to expect the unexpected. It would be wise not to become too attached to any character. Nonetheless, I must admit to having grown rather fond of little Arya and her nightly litany of the villains on her &ldquo;hitlist&rdquo; (Joffrey, the Tickler, the Hound, Ralf the Sweetling, etc.)</p>

<p>In the aftermaths of the Battle of the Blackwater, the field of contenders for the throne is narrowed considerably. Stannis retreats to Dragonstone to lick his wounds, while the Lannisters form new alliances and are stronger than ever. Now firmly ensconced on the Iron Throne, Joffrey rules with unbridled cruelty, and only Tyrion dares to stand up to him. In the north, Robb is beset on all sides and the future looks even bleaker for the Starks. Bran is gradually gaining awareness of his shapeshifting ability in his journey to the north in search of the three-eyed crow. Arya faces many perils on her wanderings, but is getting closer to home. Sansa is more miserable than ever, but is becoming stronger and wiser. Jon makes a fateful decision that would ultimately gain him great esteem, but leave him with a broken heart. In the east, Daenerys is building a formidable army; when her dragons become fully grown, she would become invincible indeed. Samwell Tarly gets his fair share of space, though he&rsquo;s one of the few characters who don&rsquo;t appear to have much impact, yet.</p>

<p>The story has grown more complex and the setting has become richer than ever. Martin has gotten a real mess on his hand, and whatever the outcome of the series, it would be phenomenal. The only complaint anyone could have against the series is the wait between installments. But if the first three books are any indication, it is well worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="AGameOfThrones" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/AGameOfThrones-198x300.jpg" width="198" height="300" />George RR Martin&rsquo;s Song of Ice and Fire series receives almost universal acclaim from reviewers. I picked up A Game of Thrones after seeing it recommended by several reviewers. Since it is billed as the entry into an epic fantasy series, I half-expected to see a fantastic world populated by magic wielders and magical creations. Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin&rsquo;s medieval universe. In fact, this book reads more like historical documentary than fantasy fiction.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s Seven Kingdoms supposedly resembles 15th-century England during the War of the Roses with the Starks and Lannisters representing the York and Lancaster families, respectively. Even the map of the Seven Kingdoms bears vague resemblance the map of Great Britain, with a vast unexplored ocean to the west, a barbaric, frozen land to the north and ancient, exotic realms to the south and east. At the forefront is the conflict between the honorable Starks of Winterfell and the cunning, powerful Lannisters of Casterly Rock for control of the Iron Throne. In the beginning of AGoT, Ned Stark finds himself installed as the right-hand man of the King, his old friend, while Lannister influence is exerted through Cersei, the beautiful but cruel Queen. Interwoven throughout are myriad other characters who weave their own intrigues and schemes. In the north, barbaric tribes and direwolves threaten to overrun the &ldquo;Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall&rdquo; guarding the Kingdoms from the frozen wastes. Worse yet, there are glimpses of the Others, mysterious undead creatures, and their army of wights raised from the dead. In the east, a Dragon princess lives among horse warriors dreaming to one day retake the throne that had belonged to her father.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s universe is distinguished by its realism. The characters behave as real people would, in realistic if not predictable fashions, with entirely believable motives. I found that reading Martin is frequently frustrating, as there is no clear line of demarcation between good and evil so common in other fantasy works. Yes, the Starks are probably good and the Lannisters likely evil, but there are many gray areas. Seeming heroes commit heinous acts, while supposed villains are entirely sympathetic. If you expect to cheer for good and see evil punished, you would be sorely disappointed, not just with AGoT but likely with the entire series. In fact, for most of the 3 books written thus far, the side of good seems to be sorely persecuted. You just have to accept things the way they are, that good and evil go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Martin seems to revel in the anti-heroes. I can&rsquo;t recall how many times I&rsquo;ve encountered dashing leading men/women and their equally winsome companions in other works. Here, beauty and wholesomeness often hide vile intentions and a cruel character &mdash; think Cersei &mdash; while Tyrion&rsquo;s deformities and ugliness disguise a truly noble spirit.</p>

<p>Martin&rsquo;s world is undeniably dark. The Seven Kingdoms is a violent world, where blood is spilled and lives are snuffed with little pretext or remorse. There is no uplifting conclusion, no triumph of good over evil. In fact, the mood at the end is decidedly downcast as a major character meets with a tragic end. However, there are lighthearted moments, such as those involving little Arya. Tyrion also has many funny lines, in a sarcastic sort of way.</p>

<p>This brilliant novel definitely breaks new ground, and quite a few stereotypes, in the fantasy genre. If this book is any indication, this promise to be phenomenal series indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went for a short hike over the long Labor Day weekend. To get there we drove through very picturesque Lincoln Center. Note to self: come back here for a bike ride in the fall. The trail head is located at the back of the very unremarkable parking lot for the local commuter train station.</p>

<p>Despite its formidable and romantic name, Mount Misery is anything but. It&rsquo;s a relatively small hill which barely rises above the tree line. However, the trail leading to it, albeit short, is full of highlights. We were greeted by several of the shy and elusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebird">blue birds</a>. Very tall coniferous trees line both sides of the trail and lush ferns cover the ground. This part brings me back to Sequoia National Park. Another stretch bisects a field of goldenrods buzzing with an army of honeybees. The trail runs through Lindentree Farms, complete with rusty old tractors and a chicken coop. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve walked through a farm!</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="http://www321.pair.com/oaries/localattitude/mountmisery.htm">excellent directions</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up to IIS 7 (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008), the default app pool identity is NetworkService 7. In IIS 7.5 (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2) the app pool identity is changed to something called ApplicationPoolIdentity.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you set up a virtual directory or application that uses this app pool. You&rsquo;ll need to grant access permission on the physical path to ApplicationPoolIdentity. However, you&rsquo;d find that there is no such user account. According to <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/webdevelopertips/archive/2009/10/02/tip-98-did-you-know-the-default-application-pool-identity-in-iis-7-5-windows-7-changed-from-networkservice-to-apppoolidentity.aspx">an IIS Team blog</a>, the user account associated with ApplicationPoolIdentity is actually <code>IIS AppPool\&lt;App pool name&gt;</code>. The intention is to further reinforce app pool isolation through the use of a separate user account for each app pool.</p>

<p>To grant permission to ApplicationPoolIdentity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the IIS Manager</li>
<li>Right-click on the desired virtual directory or application and select Edit Permission. Alternatively, you could have used Windows Explorer to browse to the physical path and open its Properties panel.</li>
<li>On the Security tab, select Edit, then Add</li>
<li>If the location is set to the domain, select Locations and change it to the local machine</li>
<li>In the textbox, enter <code>IIS AppPool\[Site Name]</code> for example, <code>IIS AppPool\Default Web Site</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Select Check Names and a valid user account name should appear</li>
</ul>


<p><img title="select-2" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/select-2-300x159.png" width="300" height="159" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Select the desired permissions; for example, Read &amp; Execute</li>
