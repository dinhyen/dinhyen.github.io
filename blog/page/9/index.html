  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Dragons_of_Winter_Night" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Dragons_of_Winter_Night-179x300.jpg" width="179" height="300" />The middle child of a trilogy has the most tenuous position. After all, the novelty may have worn off after the first installment and the big ending doesn&rsquo;t come until the next. Many are relegated to simply serve as a bridge between the first and third installment. Dragons of Winter Night defies stereotypes with its gripping storyline filled with many tense sequences and surprising revelations. True to the title, the mood is considerably darker than in the first book, ending with the heroic sacrifice of one of the main characters. Sadness is a powerful emotion, and the ending features one of the most emotionally moving scenes I can recall since Tolkien. Yet there is beauty in tragedy, and having known the ending, I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>As DoWN begins, the refugees from Pax Tharkas have found a temporary home, albeit one ill-suited for them, in the kingdom of the mountain dwarves. The companions prepare to embark on their next quest, to the ancient great city Tarsis the Beautiful, in search of a better refuge. Little do they know that evil forces are already following their tracks and laying a trap for them. Events in Tarsis would force the companions to split into two groups, each searching for an ancient artifact that allows the wielder to exert control over dragons. Their adventures would take them to distant lands, fraught with dark mystery and danger. Some of the companions will have grown in power, some in knowledge, some in maturity, and some would find love along the way. In a sense, the wide-eyed innocence of the first volume has worn off. As the characters gain experience, their worries and sorrows also increase. Laurana is a case in point. She has changed greatly since leaving Qualinost. No longer the happy elfmaiden innocent to the ways of the world, she has become more and more like Tanis, wiser yet weighed down with care and sadness.</p>

<p>Tanis would encounter a figure from the past that would prove to be his greatest temptation thus far and force him to reconsider his beliefs and loyalty in a whole new light.</p>

<p>Despite the prevailing depressive mood, there are many light moments. My favorite character, Tas, is as funny as ever and is given more screen time than before. While the focus has been taken off some characters such as Goldmoon and Riverwind, Tas would shoulder more responsiblities and even makes a few crucial discoveries, unwittingly of course.</p>

<p>In light of its gripping storyline and powerful emotional undercurrents, it would not be unfair to characterize DoWN as a fantasy masterpiece.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="DragonsofSpringDawning" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/DragonsofSpringDawning.jpg" width="177" height="300" />After the setback at the end of book two, hope finally dawns on Krynn. For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat. Nevertheless, the Dark Lady has a devious ruse of her own that would deal a devastating blow to the forces of good from which they may not recover. Meanwhile, the other half of the sundered fellowship struggles to bring back the Silvanesti dragon orb and reunite with their friends. Their efforts are meaningless to Raistlin, who already have found a way to wield the power of the orb and whose mind may have turned to darkness. The end comes in a frantic rush as the companions fight to rescue their friends in the evil lair of Takhisis, prevent the Queen of Darkness from gaining corporeal existence in Krynn, and finally escape with their lives. All the while, the nightmare that they all shared in the twisted woods of Silvanesti would come back to haunt them in the waking world.</p>

<p>The thrills are not diminished from book two. One of the hallmarks of this book, and perhaps of the series, is unpredictability. Character make decisions out of love, fear and remorse, that seem to be unwise from the reader&rsquo;s standpoint; yet at the same time, these are the very marks that make them human (or otherwise). On the flip side, while some antagonists may come off as irreconcilably evil, the Dark Lady is more complex. Her insatiable thirst for power makes her callous, yet there are times when one can&rsquo;t help but feel some sympathy for her.</p>

<p>The climax takes place in several places at once and comes in a frenzy of actions that are as exciting as I&rsquo;ve seen. Despite the somewhat happy ending, there is still a dark overtone. Evil is not wholly defeated and still reigns supreme in some parts of land. Victory is paid for at great costs, and there is little cheer and much poignancy as the companions gather for the last time before going their separate ways. The sweetness of victory is tempered by the memory of those who are gone and by the knowledge that those who remain are no longer the same. Nevertheless, the end is also uplifting by the realization that true friendship and love can endure.</p>

<p>The Chronicles has left a legacy of memorable characters. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that, despite the many DragonLance sequels, many of them won&rsquo;t play a major role again. Thus the Chronicles can be said to be unique and special in this sense. Other fantasy works have left me impressed, awed, even shocked, but few have been as moving as the Chronicles. If any work can be said to have captured the spirit of Tolkien, the Chronicles would have my vote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="DragonsofAutumnTwilight" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/DragonsofAutumnTwilight.jpg" width="179" height="300" />The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators. The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all. To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious. Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since. Dragons of Autumn Twilight has many rough edges, typical for a first book in a series, but it fulfills its role admirably and paves the way for a crescendo in the second and third book.</p>

<p>All of the main characters are introduced very early on. In fact, most of them already know each other. Five life-long friends agree to reunite after a long separation. There&rsquo;s Tanis Half-Elven, the mongrel who serves as the group&rsquo;s de facto leader. Raistlin Majere is the creepy mage who recently underwent a disturbing transformation, physical and possibly much more; his twin, the warrior Caramon, is a gentle giant who&rsquo;s somewhat simple-minded but unswervingly faithful. Sturm Brightblade is an austere paladin seeking to attain knighthood and restore honor to his family and to the disgraced Knights of Solamnia. Flint Fireforge is an old, hot-tempered dwarf who, despite his gruff demeanor, considers the others his only family. Rounding out the company is Tasslehoff Burrfoot, a lovable kender who bubbles with curiosity and loves to lay his hands on other people&rsquo;s belongings. It was a troubled time, with news of war abroad and disturbing rumors of strange creatures walking the lands. Soon, the company runs into a mysterious barbarian princess and her grim escort. She bears a staff with strange powers that soon proves to be the source of their troubles.</p>

<p>There is no lack of adventure and exotic locales. The party finds themselves whisked on one fantastic, and deadly, journey after another. They will have traveled from the tree city Solace to Darken Wood, never before seen by living eyes, to the legendary ruined city Xak Tsaroth, where black wings of death reign, to the secret elven city Qualinost, with its slender and graceful spires, to the long abandoned fortress Pax Tharkas, now teeming with sinister forces. Strange, fantastic creatures hinder and aid their journey, and rumors have it that dragons have returned out of legends to spread destruction across the lands.</p>

<p>The main characters scream &ldquo;stereotypes&rdquo;. But remember that this book was one of the first, so such accusation would be unfair. Tanis is a conflicted protagonist, tortured by the passions of his human heritage and the aloofness and passivity of his elven heritage. He&rsquo;s also torn between his desire for the tempestuous human warrior Kitiara and his love for the sweet but inexperienced elfmaiden Laurana. The others seem somewhat one-dimensional. Caramon is unfailingly obsequious to his brother, Sturm unbendingly upholds his ideals of honor and chilvalry, Riverwind is always grim, Goldmoon has boundless compassions, Flint is deathly afraid of boats, the seemingly evil Raistlin spouts one foreboding comment after another, in between in bouts of racking coughs. It seems Raistlin does little else; we know he&rsquo;s sorely bothered by his coughs, can we just move on? Raistlin would become the focus for later books, but I must admit I do not find him very interesting in this book, even though among the group he has the most potential for intrigue. My favorite character is Tas. Despite obviously being the comic relief, his ofttimes silly little adventures are quite funny. I love his exchanges with Flint, who never quite carries out his threat to throttle the lovable kender. He has a lot of Bilbo Baggins in him.</p>

<p>The first part of the book up until Xak Tsaroth is as good as it gets. The mood is evil and foreboding and the reader has no idea what to expect. The first encounter with the draconians gives the impression that they are mysterious, deadly, and very hard to defeat. However, after the meeting with the gully dwarves, the book takes an abrupt turn and becomes&hellip; comical. The fight scenes in Xak Tsaroth are light-hearted, almost slapstick-like. The draconians proceed to lose most of their fearsome aura and become no more than your average goons. I&rsquo;m also not sure if the whole treatment of the gully dwarves in Xak Tsaroth are supposed to be comic relief or not. If so, it ruins the mood of one of the more exciting sections of the book. I&rsquo;m also dismayed by the lack of fighting prowess of the characters. The humans are fair enough fighters, but despite his age and experience, Flint is virtually a liability in battle. Raistlin is capable of casting only a few noneffectual spells before he tires and has to rest. The elflords too are rather weak and easily defeated. And everyone is so susceptible to magical attacks that they can be easily disabled. I suppose, like in an RPG, the party gain power as they gain experience. Still, this is a novel, not a game. Given their adventuring experience, the characters should have more martial prowess than they are given credit for.</p>

<p>The authors have shown a lot of imagination in bring to life the many ruins and dungeons the party has to explore. However, many adventures seem to be rushed, as if the authors are trying to cram as many as possible into the book. For one thing, I would&rsquo;ve liked to learn more about Xak Tsaroth, Qualinost, or the dungeons of Sla-Mori. The descriptions are too brief and fail bring out all the grandeur and mystery the idea of these places can inspire in the reader.</p>

<p>Overall, the book has a great beginning, a so-so middle, and a good ending. The way is paved for the next installment of the series, a masterpiece! So get this one out of the way and get started on Dragons of Winter Night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Doom3" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Doom3-206x300.jpg" width="206" height="300" />The original Doom introduced a whole new world to video games. It had a vast, immersive, incredibly realistic environment which gave the player an experience closer to reality than anything else had been able to achieve (having non-orthogonal walls helped). In retrospect, the drawbacks of two-dimensional graphics and comical looking monsters didn&rsquo;t detract much from the overall experience. Doom might not have invented the first-person shooter, but it made it a bona fide genre.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present. In a world where the first-person shooter is held to the highest scrutiny and players have elevated standards regarding graphics, level design, and game play, Doom 3 comes out amid great expectations that it, again, would reinvent the genre.</p>

<p>When it comes to graphics, this is certainly true. This game has perhaps the most visually impressive environment of any game. id games have always had the reputation for being well-polished and they certainly have outdone themselves on this one. The attention to detail is incredible. The textures look so real you almost want to reach out and touch them. There is an endless variety of them and no two places look exactly alike, just as in real life. What&rsquo;s even more impressive is the lighting. id set out to reinvent lighting and succeeded. The moment you caught a horrifying glimpse of a monster&rsquo;s grinning visage as it crosses a shaft of light, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>Sound is another dimension all together. In an environment of dark corridors, dimly lit with the beam of your flashlight or with a flickering overhead light, the effect of sounds becomes magnified. The environment is alive with sounds &mdash; the background hum of machinery, the sparks of exposed electrical wires, the whoosh of doors sliding open, your own footsteps, the distant screams of dying humans, the hisses and roars of monsters, the hair-raising groans of zombies, creepy whispers by who-knows-what, and on top of it all the pounding of your own heart. All these make for a truly terrifying environment. I&rsquo;ve had to jump out of my seat several times. id has definitely raised the bar when it comes to making sound effects an essential feature of the game environment.</p>

<p>For the most part, Doom 3 is a remake of the old game with the storyline fleshed out with several added twists. The year is 2145. The game opens with the protagonist on a drop ship enroute to a Union Aerospace Corporation installation on Mars that houses both scientific and military facilities. This is where cutting-edge research in physics are carried out that would revolutionize human civilization. Everything seems routine, though you soon learn of experiments seemingly gone awry and disturbing happenings around the facility. Soon you&rsquo;re ordered to descend below ground to search for a missing scientist, then all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>In the original game, the imps were brown humanoids with a very human rear end, while the pink bull-like monsters were perhaps a shade too pink, and I always thought the giant floating balls with eyes were a bit outlandish. The monsters are now truly terrifying. They&rsquo;re bigger, faster, meaner. Pinkie, now appropriately flesh-colored, rushes headlong into you and turns you into human pulp.  The imp crouches low before lunging at you with his claw-like appendages outstretched, threatening to swipe your head off. Undead humans and hellish creatures such as the spider-like Trites, the two-headed Maggots, the missile-spewing Revenants, and the hulking Hellknights stalk the dark hallways and make Doom 3 a very unsafe place to be. If there&rsquo;s any complaint at all, it&rsquo;s that the skin of the creatures can appear somewhat rubbery or plasticky.</p>

<p>Nothing, no matter how great, is free from flaws, and Doom 3 is no exception. In this case, this has to do with game design and game play. In concept, Doom 3 is akin to a house of horrors, where you have no control over you environment or where you go; you&rsquo;ll have to fend off pre-set traps and play along until you&rsquo;re out. You go from one area to the next, clear out monsters, move the next area, do the same, rinse and repeat. While the experience may be enthralling, the process gets tedious after a while. Other shooters may entice you with a variety of environments, a variety of missions, a variety of characters, or a variety of vehicles or equipment to operate. In Doom 3, it&rsquo;s the same mission and, except for a few excursions, mostly the same environment. Your only rewards are additional weapons and bits and pieces of information which reveal a little more of the storyline. I kind of looked forward to fighting alongside other teammates, but the only thing close to that is following a robotic sentry which blasts everything in its path.</p>

<p>True to the house of horrors analogy, Doom 3 is replete with surprises and traps. Approaching a cache of goodies would trigger the lights to go out, the wall panel ahead to slide open revealing its unpleasant inhabitants and more often than not some demon is spawning behind you. Now you can&rsquo;t see and can&rsquo;t move because you&rsquo;re confined in some corridors. The only way is to try and blast your way out of there, find some health kits, take a deep breath and prepare to do it again. Some players may find this thrilling, others may feel frustrated at the lack of control and, yes, the repetitiveness of it all.</p>

<p>The other complaint has to do with game play. The designers could have had their pick of the features common nowadays in shooters, such as the ability to peer around corners, a secondary fire on weapons, or even additional weapons like flame throwers, trip mines or for god&rsquo;s sake night vision goggles would be welcome. I suppose they decide to stay faithful to the original repertoire of weaponry (with one additional weapon), even though the monsters have now grown more numerous and deadly. The designers also require the player to hold either the flashlight or the weapon, but not both. So one is faced with the predicament of being able to see and not fire, or being able to fire and not see. For some players this is a feature which enhances the experience. Others, like me, are left to wonder why our hero can&rsquo;t hold the flashlight with the non-weapon hand, or find some duct tape to attach the flashlight to his weapon or armor. On the other hand, monsters, even those that are formerly humans, have no problems seeing in the dark. The odds aren&rsquo;t good for you.</p>

<p>As much fun as the game can be, it gets monotonous after a while for me. Maybe when mods start coming out from the enthusiast community, then we&rsquo;d really see the true potential of this fantastic engine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="destiny_child_of_the_sky" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/destiny_child_of_the_sky-191x300.jpg" width="191" height="300" />2003 seems to be a good year for epic fantasy, with the impending release of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s 10th Wheel of Time book in January, George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s 4th Song of Fire and Ice book in April, and Terry Goodkind&rsquo;s 8th Sword of Truth book in June. That afterwards fans of these series will be left to languish for a couple of years is not a savory thought. In light of this reality, that Elizabeth Haydon fulfills the promise of bringing the Rhapsody series to a satisfying conclusion (though not THE conclusion) in a reasonable amount of time seems very satisfying indeed.</p>

<p>In Destiny, Rhapsody and Achmed must track down the children spawned by the F&#8217;dor to purge them of the evil taint and also to acquire enough essence of the demon in order for the Dhracian to hunt it down. Llauron the Invoker continues to work behind the scene to forward his unknown plan, with Ashe as his unwilling accomplice. Deep in the mountain fortress of Ylorc, Grunthor must strengthen the Bolg army for a terrible and hopeless battle that Rhapsody has foreseen. Meanwhile, the F&#8217;dor, the identity of its human host now narrowed down to among a handful of powerful people, continues to spread the seeds of chaos and wanton destruction to bring its plot yet closer to fruition. Most grievously, Ashe must part from Rhapsody bearing a secret that would break her heart, but that must not be revealed lest their plan will fail. Then there is the question of the reunification of the ancient Cymrians and their descendants if the glory and prosperity of the land are to endure. These questions will be answered in Destiny, and some readers would be beyond thrilled when the business with Meridion is revealed at last.</p>

<p>Destiny fails to provide the actions and thrills so abundant the first two volumes. No strange lands nor major characters are introduced. The first half of the book consists of Rhapsody and Achmed tracking down the various demon-spawns, some young and some not so young, and cajoling away or kidnapping them. While this can be seen as essential to the development of the plot, it&rsquo;s hardly exciting nor adventurous. Though there are some tantalizing threads, such as the discovery of the tunnel under the forge in Yarim, they turn out to be red herrings. Rhapsody&rsquo;s adventure at the gladiator ring in Sorbold is fascinating for a while, but nothing further is made of it. Some revelations regarding the history of the Lirin warrior Oelendra and Anborn may be interesting to some, but more likely rather flat and tepid. Even the whole business with Llauron proves disappointing; yes, it provides the fuel for the deception and betrayal that may tear the lovers apart, but even this could have been done away without significantly altering the plot. Haydon likes to tantalize readers with clues to the identity of the F&#8217;dor. While she has done so admirably in book two, she may have overdone it in this book with numerous passages from the point of view of the antagonist. The identity of the F&#8217;dor is apparent long before it is finally revealed. While this may have been the author&rsquo;s intention, it hardly enhances the suspense when the heroes themselves finally make the discovery. Most of the book seems to plod toward the inevitable confrontation between the heroes and villain, and such is the lone bright spot of the book.</p>

<p>One may admit that the F&#8217;dor is not as formidable a villain as many others. While it and its minions are capable of heinous acts, such as the sacrifice of children, it&rsquo;s hardly omnipotent or even omniscient. Its power is manifested more through its guile and insidiousness than through pure destructiveness. It&rsquo;s known all along that it can be contained, captured and defeated. Thus it&rsquo;s no surprise that the sense of imminent threat and hopelessness aren&rsquo;t readily apparent when the companions finally face the demon. However, Haydon has done a an excellent job to bring thrills and chills, and a frantic rush of actions, to this climactic confrontation. When the F&#8217;dor is able to bring both its power and its guile to bear, it&rsquo;s a frightening opponent indeed, and for a brief moment the outcome of the battle seems hardly certain. Even when victory is within grasp, the demon&rsquo;s counterstroke may have shorn of it of sweetness and joy. For me, this is the climax of the book, more so than the subsequent battle with yet another villain nor the unraveling and fruition of the romantic subplot (which by the way bears a distaste for me since book two).</p>

<p>Destiny may have been a weaker conclusion than its predecessors have led us to hope. But considered overall, the series leaves an enduring legacy of memorable characters and a fascinating world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Crossroads_of_Twilight" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Crossroads_of_Twilight-207x300.jpg" width="207" height="300" />It&rsquo;s tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many fewer pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn&rsquo;t give them anything interesting to do. For instance, more than 130 pages and 5 chapters are devoted to Elayne trying on dresses, taking hot baths, and fretting over her pregnancy (and other momentous events in Caemlyn). By the time RJ segued into the next character, I was left to wonder if what I had just read had to do with anything. Similarly, two chapters were devoted to Perrin buying grain and supplies for his army. Come on RJ, buying grain? After the cliff-hanger ending of Winter&rsquo;s Heart, I eagerly looked forward to seeing what Rand would do next. Much to my chagrin, Rand was not mentioned until page 500-something. The few chapters concerning him were all too brief, and he did nothing that merited excitement . With such prodigal use of space, it&rsquo;s no wonder that the pace is even more &ldquo;glacial&rdquo; than in previous books. If you think that the last four books were slow, wait till you read COT. By the end of the book, Mat was barely out of Ebou Dar, Perrin was no closer to rescuing Faile (maybe that&rsquo;s a blessing in disguise because frankly I find her annoying), Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai were still besieging Tar Valon, Rand was sitting on his hands again with Cadsuane shadowing him night and day, Elayne was doing whatever it was that she did in Caemlyn, and we were no closer to Tarmon Gai&#8217;don than we had ever been.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m well aware that this installment supposedly sets the background for the next and final 2 books. The title implies that momentous decisions made here would determine how future events would unfold. So the rebel Aes Sedai&rsquo;s decision concerning the Black Tower, Perrin&rsquo;s decision concerning the Seanchan, and Rand&rsquo;s decision concerning the Seanchan would have serious repercussions. In fact, throughout the book were sprinkled abundant clues of plans already set or to be set in motion. However, it soon became apparent that RJ had no intention to reveal those plans in COT, except for a tantalizing hint in the epilogue. The epilogue! At best guess, readers will find out in the next installment, which would come out in, oh, 2006 or so. It&rsquo;s amazing that in nearly 700 pages RJ could manage to reveal so little, or at least so little that would satisfy readers. Even RJ&rsquo;s sly, tongue-in-cheek comments and remarks that used to amuse me so much were growing stale. And several times I got the nagging feeling that he was repeating himself. I used to think that when Tarmon Gai&#8217;don finally comes around it would be sad because the series would be over. I never thought that it would be &hellip; boring. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve had more fun reading the theory posts and predictions on wotmania.com. Perhaps RJ should consider changing his oft-used comment, RAFO &ndash; Read And Find Out, to RAFA &ndash; Read And Fall Asleep.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Canon&rsquo;s S30 fills a nice niche between expensive, feature-laden cameras and point-and-shoots. Its compact size, snug enough to fit in the palm of your hand and perfect for slipping into a pocket, makes it an ideal companion for those excursions when a larger camera would be too bulky or conspicuous. The silver all-metal body is sleek and stylish, so much that it&rsquo;s almost a fashion accessory. It&rsquo;s loaded with features, an amazing feat for such a small package, while at the same time offers unparalleled ease of use. Lastly, it&rsquo;s a great deal considering its price-feature ratio.</p>

<p>The S30 includes the usual automatic presets such as landscape and portrait, but also offers the semi-automatic and fully manual modes that a serious photographer would want. The following adjustments may come in handy: 1) film speed from ASA-equivalent 50 to 800, 2) spot, center-weighted and evaluative metering modes, 3) three selectable autofocus areas, 4) exposure compensation between -2 and 2 EV in steps of 1/3 EV, 5) continuous drive mode (though maxing out at a modest 2.5fps), 6) macro mode. While I still prefer an SLR in most situations, the S30 fills many of my needs very nicely. I use the it to take preview or experimental shots or to take shots that I would hesitate to blow film on. Morever, the S30 makes your job a cinch when it comes to panoramas. The panoramic mode shows you a third of the previous frame, either vertical or horizontal, which is an invaluable guide to help you line up the current frame. I used to have to spend a lot of time in Photoshop to line up adjacent frames and erase the seams between frames. Canon&rsquo;s Photostitch software does all of that and more, at the click of a button!</p>

<p>Picture quality is very good, with excellent sharpness throughout the image and no noticeable softness in the corners at wide-angle. Macro shots are very sharp, to the point that I decided to do close-ups primarily with the S30. Colors can be a little flat, but this can be easily fixed in Photoshop. There is a special &ldquo;Vivid&rdquo; or saturated mode, but this comes at the expense of losing other controls over the shot. I&rsquo;ve noticed that the dynamic range for the CCD sensor is quite low, much worse than for color negatives or slides. This is most apparent if you&rsquo;ve got a mixed light and dark scene; either the sky would be washed out or the foreground would be underexposed. This could be a shortcoming of CCDs in general and not one particular to the S30.</p>

<p>The S30&rsquo;s 3-megapixels resolution is good enough for a 2048x1536 image, which in turn is sufficient for 8x10 enlargements. If this is not large enough for your needs, the S40 ups the ante to 4 megapixels. There is a USB jack for downloading images and an A/V jack for previewing images on TV. You will want to invest in a CF card-reader however, for convenience&rsquo;s sake. The storage slot takes Type I or II CF cards, and also accommodates a Microdrive.</p>

<p>The S30&rsquo;s compact size is its greatest asset, but is also responsible for a few shortcomings. The 1.8&#8221; LCD screen is bright and contrasty, but only indoors. Lacking a swivel and anti-glare coating, it&rsquo;s virtually useless outdoors. You may have to resort to the optical viewfinder, which does not cover 100 percent of the image. The LCD displays most useful information, but inexplicably lacks a battery life indicator. You&rsquo;d have no idea how much power is left until the low-battery indicator flashes. To make matters worse, the rechargeable Li-Ion battery has rather short lifespan, between 30-50 shots. I have to carry 2 spare batteries in order to shoot for a whole day. The thumb-operated directional controller is rather awkward to use. You scroll to move up/down and press to move left/right. To select, you have to press down on the middle. In my case, to hit select, I had to learn a way to press it just right, otherwise the controller would move left or right instead. Lastly, while this may not matter much to most people, I frequently use a tripod, which blocks the battery cover and makes changing battery quite a hassle.</p>

<p>Despite its shortcomings, I&rsquo;ve found the S30 to be an indispensable companion. I&rsquo;ve had it for almost a year and taken it with me on trips to Asia and throughout western North America. At times I yearned for a more advanced camera like the Canon G2 or even a digital SLR, but more often than not I found myself thankful that I was able to take pictures I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken otherwise with a larger camera. The S30 has more than paid for itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="The_Pillars_of_Creation" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/The_Pillars_of_Creation-197x300.jpg" width="197" height="300" />Pillars of Creation follows the adventures of a young woman, Jennsen, illegitimate daughter of Darken Rahl, as she travels the world in search of escape and vengeance. She is aided by a spy of the Imperial Order who may be more than he appears to be. At the same time, Jennsen&rsquo;s unique ability may mean the end of all life, if she and Richard don&rsquo;t discover the truth in time.</p>

<p>Many reviewers have lamented the departure from the main plot line. True enough, the storyline here has little to do with the last installment, with the Midlands war and Richard&rsquo;s liberation of Altur&#8217;Rang. However, there are enough materials to advance some aspects of the story, notably the whereabouts of Nathan and the Imperial Order&rsquo;s attack on Aydindril. We also learn a great deal about the hitherto mostly unknown land of D&#8217;Hara and its people under the rule of the new Lord Rahl. This installment expands the Sword of Truth universe while introducing a character who may prove to be essential later in the series.</p>

<p>The writing is impeccable. I think Goodkind has gone a long way from the first book. My main complaint has to do with his pacing. As he has done in some previous installments, the story plods along until it builds up into a climax in the last few chapters. Much of the story helps to build the characters, and characterization is something Goodkind is very good at, but he tends to overdo it sometimes. Goodkind brings to life a very sympathetic character in Jennsen, but he also creates some remarkably revulsive and twisted characters, and readers are forced to bear with these rather one-dimensional creatures to the point of exasperation. In Goodkind&rsquo;s fashion, the climax tends to come in a frantic rush, with characters converging and clashing in an all-or-nothing melee. In this one, though, the end seems to be too sitcom-like and neatly wrapped for my taste. At the same time, it leaves out enough details to leave me somewhat unsatisfied, such as what the &ldquo;pillars of creation&rdquo; have to do with anything or why Richard and company happens to be travelling to a wasteland in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of these questions will be addressed in the next installment, but then again, perhaps not. The only thing certain is that we&rsquo;ll have to wait six months to find out. But I suppose such is the lot for fans of epic fantasy.</p>

<p>My ranking of the series so far is as follows:</p>

<p>Book IV: Temple of the Winds
Book III: Blood of the Fold
Book VI: Faith of the Fallen
Book II: Stone of Tears
Book I: Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule
Book VII: Pillars of Creation
Book V: Soul of the Fire</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="pull-left" title="Temple_of_the_Winds" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/Temple_of_the_Winds-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" />I must admit I wasn&rsquo;t very impressed when I started reading the 1st book of the series. In Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule, Goodkind&rsquo;s writing just didn&rsquo;t seem to possess a certain sophistication and polish, and at times it had such a wooden quality that I found myself squirming. Now after having read through the 5th book of the series, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve stuck around! As the tale progresses, so does the author&rsquo;s mastery of his craft. Now I find myself swallowing up every word. This book is my favorite of the series. It has all the adventures and mysteries of the previous volumes, at the same time has a surprising emotional edge, not only between the main characters but between some secondary characters as well. Richard and Kahlan will have to face their most severe trial thus far, and it wasn&rsquo;t a result of them doing something annoyingly stupid like running off alone into unknown danger. All the twists and turns building up to the climax will glue your eyes to the pages. The last 100 pages or so are as masterfully executed as any. Even if the previous volumes have taught you to expect the unexpected, the unmasking of the villain may yet surprise some. Goodkind&rsquo;s handling and manipulating of story threads are perhaps his greatest asset. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m somewhat dismayed at his penchant for killing off characters, even those he had painstakingly portrayed, by the end of the story.</p>

<p>This book is perhaps the pinnacle of the series; the subsequent volumes just don&rsquo;t come close to matching its thrills and excitement. Expect many a sleepless night once you pick this one up.</p>

The surprising discoveries, the heart-pounding action of the previous volumes are missing here, even during the climax, and the main danger seems somehow diminished and unimportant. The storyline doesn&rsquo;t concern much with magic; in fact the absence of it is the crux of the story. What we&rsquo;ve got left has mostly to do with the world of ordinary, non-magic people (muggles?) and their endless plotting and machinations. Perhaps because I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t care much for politics, I find most of the plot borderline dull. Even the climax seems rushed, being resolved in about 15 pages or so, and leaves many loose ends. Perhaps most annoyingly, the main characters go out and put themselves in danger needlessly and trivially; knowing that things would be tied together somehow in the end doesn&rsquo;t make it any less annoying. The emotional veins that make the previous volumes so endearing are conspicuously absent here; there are few sympathetic characters to latch on to, to exhort. The only thrills I had with this book have to do with Cara&rsquo;s adventures, few though they are. This volume is the weakest in the series thus far. I can only hope number 6 will be better.</p>
