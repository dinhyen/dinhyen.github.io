  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zdeno Chara grabbed hold of the Cup, reverently brought it to his lips, then raised it above his head, repeating a ritual performed by all previous Cup-winning captains. The only difference was that it had not been done by someone wearing the spoked-B since Nixon was President.  The events of this night surely sent Bruins fans everywhere into a delirium.  For the entire time that the Bruins celebrated on the ice, I had a stupidly wide grin on my face.  I am quite sure I wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>

<p>When the playoffs started back in April, not many fans would have thought this outcome to be possible.   The Bruins certainly did not make things easy on themselves. They started the playoffs with two disheartening home losses to the Montréal Canadiens that had even the most optimistic fans staring into the abyss.  They had struggled mightily against the Canadiens during the regular season, dropping all road games against them, even though they came up with two huge wins at home.  Now they faced the prospect of having to win at the Bell Centre, an arena notoriously hard for opposing teams to play in.  But just when people counted them out, the team shone. They dug deep and silenced the raucous Bell Centre crowd with two wins of their own, one of which in overtime.  They eked out a win in Game 5 in double-overtime before losing a hard-fought Game 6 thanks to not one but two five-on-three power-play goals for the Canadiens. Game 7 was a nail-biter.  They scored two early goals, but the dangerous Canadiens evened the score. The teams traded goals in the 3rd period, with the Canadiens scoring on a now predictable late-game power play, sending the game to yet another overtime. This time, it was Nathan Horton&rsquo;s turn to be the hero.  With just 5 &frac12; minutes gone, he sent a blistering one-timer off a pass from Milan Lucic past Carey Price, putting the home crowd into a frenzy and propelling the Bruins past their their toughest test of this playoffs. Three overtime games, including Game 7&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t have gotten any tighter than this.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the Stanley Cup Finals.  Before the series began, the Canucks were the overwhelming favorite as the best team in the NHL.  Things got even bleaker as the Canucks took the first two games in thrilling fashion (or deflating if you&rsquo;re a Bruins fan).   Then just when you think things couldn&rsquo;t get any worse, early in Game 3 Bruins playoffs hero Horton was knocked senseless by a vicious hit  from Aaron Rome and had to be carried off the ice on a stretcher.  A lesser team would have been cowed and beaten. But true to the form of a champion, the Bruins rallied around their fallen teammate.  They humiliated the Canucks with an 8-1 victory in Game 3 and twice more at home, pushing the series to Game 7.  Despite the hype leading up to it, the climactic game  turned out not to be as tense as previous must-win games against the Canadiens and the Tampa Bay Lightning.  Canucks starter Roberto Luongo had been stellar in previous three home games but downright horrible in the three games played in Boston.  Sensing vulnerability, the Bruins pushed hard.  Near the end of a back-and-forth first period, Patrice Bergeron broke through with a brilliant goal&mdash;made possible by an excellent cycling effort from Brad Marchand&mdash;that Luongo only saw after the puck had already gone past him.  Marchand got the job done himself mid-way through the 2nd period with a wrap-around goal that Luongo failed to keep out of his net. Five minutes later, Bergeron put a nail in the coffin of the Canucks&#8217; much vaunted power-play with a short-handed goal.  Even with more than a period left in the game, by this time the Bruins were firmly in control. With Tim Thomas stopping everything the Canucks put on the Bruins&#8217; net, the game was merely a formality when Marchand punctuated the victory with an empty-net goal.</p>

<p>Before the series began, the Canucks forwards had been deemed too fast and too strong.  They scored exactly 8 goals over 7 games and their best stars were largely invisible.  The Canucks defense were deemed too mobile and too deep.  They looked like a beaten and battered bunch by the end.  The Canucks power-play was deemed the most potent in decades; it was a deadly weapon in their easy series victories over the Predators and Sharks. Against the Bruins it yielded just 2 goals but gave up 3 short-handed goals. Luongo was considered a more solid and reliable goalie than Tim Thomas given the latter&rsquo;s unconventional style.  Yet the Bruins shellacked him in Boston, putting 8 pucks past him in one game and forcing him to be pulled in the others, a feat unheard of in the Stanley Cup Finals.  All the while Thomas was matching or outplaying his counterpart in nearly every facet.</p>

<p>There are many things to be proud of this year&rsquo;s team.  Overcoming a 0-2 deficit, twice, to win a series. Beating their hated and most dangerous rival.  Sweeping the team that had dealt them such an ignominious end in the previous playoffs.  Scoring the fastest four goals in a Finals game to set the stage for an epic upset of the Cup favorite.  And finally, bringing home the Stanley Cup after a 39-year absence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s the eve before the biggest game in my history as a Bruins fan.  I&rsquo;m so nervous I&rsquo;m going to have problem going to sleep.  I had known about hockey quite early on since Las Vegas had a minor-league team, the now-defunct Las Vegas Thunder, and a friend was a big fan.  Despite knowing so little about the game, I was hooked immediately when I came to Boston in the mid-90s.  The  grace and speed intermixed with the power and physical intensity, in my mind, elevate hockey above all other team sports.  I remember cheering for the dynamic duo of Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov.  Samsonov was my favorite player because of his small stature and mesmerizing puck-handling skill.  I remember feeling sad when Ray Bourque was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 2000, then being elated when he won the Stanley Cup the following season.  When Bourque brought the Cup back to a rally at City Hall, I was among the thousands who showed up to cheer for him.</p>

<p>It has been a rollercoaster ride being a Bruins fan in recent years.  But certainly my experience pales in comparison to those who have not seen them raise the Stanley Cup since 1972.  Now they&rsquo;re on the verge of erasing the frustration and anguish of a generation of fans.  There would not be a better road to the Cup than this.  They already overcame their arch-nemesis, the Montréal Canadiens, without facing whom the quest would somehow seem incomplete.  By defeating the Philadelphia Flyers with a 4-0 sweep, they came close to erasing the ignonimity of the previous season&mdash;being only the 3rd team in hockey history and 4th team in sports history to lose a series after leading 3-0.  They outlasted a talented Tampa Bay team with a late goal in the last possible game of the series.</p>

<p>And here we are.  All the biting incidents, bone-crushing hits, concussion and resultant suspension, blow-out games, shocking overtime goals&mdash;they all mean nothing.  Two teams, one game to decide who will raise the most legendary trophy in all of sports.  One game to decide the fate of two fan bases&mdash;who will be elated beyond belief, who will plummet to the depth of despair.  For my part, it&rsquo;s my ardent hope to be making plans for lining up along Boylston Street waiting for the Duck Boats later this week.  It would be the best time of my life as a sports fan.</p>

<p>The Boston Globe site has a <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/extras/share_your_bruins_pride_photos/">feature </a>in which people upload their fan photos.  The photos consist of a multitude of babies, pets, black-and-gold face paints, flags and other paraphernalia, the Ice Girls, Blade the bear, a mohawk, a Bruins logo mown into the lawn, Bruins celebrities, Halloween costumes, and several replica Stanley Cups. Among the photos that caught my attention for their creativity and daringness are these.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TD Bank Garden, Boston on June 8, around 19:00.  It was moments before Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals between the Boston Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks.  In the darkened arena, packed to the rafters with almost 18000 screaming fans, the lone spotlight descended on an area in the stands.  Momentarily, a middle-aged man clad in a vintage Bruins jersey stepped into the light.  The crowd erupted.  It was none other than the legendary Bobby Orr, the man universally regarded as the finest defenseman in the history of hockey.  Most Bruins fans would contend that he is the best hockey player to ever lace up skates, no slight intended for the Great One. Fittingly, the man whose statue stands outside the arena was also part of the last Bruins squad to bring the Cup home nearly 4 decades ago.</p>

<p>Someone handed Orr a flag.  It bore the number 18, the number worn by Bruins winger Nathan Horton who was knocked out of the series thanks to a terrible hit by Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome early in Game 3.  As Orr waved the flag in honor of Horton, the already feverish crowd was sent into an unprecedented level of frenzy.  It was a goose bumps-inducing moment for Bruins fans everywhere.</p>

<p>As ardently hoped for and expected, the Bruins responded for their Hall of Fame-hero and for their fallen hero.  They dominated the Canucks, beating them physically and on the scoreboard, 4-0.  The series now shifts back to Vancouver for Game 5 on Friday.  Even though the series is tied 2-2, the Bruins are riding a bullet train of momentum.  If they take Game 5, the Stanley Cup will be in the building for Game 6, something for which many Bruins fans have waited decades if not all of their lives.</p>

<p>The Stanley Cup Playoffs, it&rsquo;s simply the best thing there is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The flight was to be at 13:00 so we planned on departing no later than 10:30.  That left us about 1h after breakfast to explore downtown San Jose.  We were 4 blocks away from the Jade Museum, which owns the largest collection of Pre-Columbian jade artifacts anywhere. Unfortunately a museum was out of the question given the time constraint.</p>

<figcaption>Parque Morazán</figcaption></p>

<p>There are quite a few pleasant green spaces which serve to provide respite in the brick and concrete jungle.  Our first stops were parks.  Parque Morazán features a rotunda which serves as a bandstand and the unofficial symbol of San Jose. Parque España is particularly nice, with tall shade trees and statuaries. One is of Juan Vásquez de Coronado, remembered as the colonizer of Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Avenida Central is closed to traffic.  As we walked about, we found out that a few other streets are also pedestrian-only in the downtown area.  This arrangement gives foot traffic the preferential treatment and is an excellent idea.  The area was packed with locals, even on a Sunday night when we arrived.  We wanted to make it to Mercado Central, but unfortunately ran out of time only a few blocks away.</p>

<p>San Jose has its interesting sides, but we&rsquo;d much prefer to be in the forest and countryside. Unfortunately, it was time to go.  Hopefully, we will be able to come back soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went down to breakfast and ran into the Coopers.  They had survived the trip from Arenal after all.  However, this would be the last time that we saw them.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-6/DSC_0514(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>Alan the entomologist at Monteverde Butterfly Garden</figcaption></p>

<p>First stop was the butterfly garden, also infamous as the residence of the tarantulas.  Our guide, Alan, must have come straight out of Walter&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy biologist guy&rdquo; mold.  Again extremely knowledgeable about his charges, he was full of information on the insects and arachnids that resided in the terrariums. Kate has something of mortal arachnophobia, so it was particularly brave of her to handle the hairy red-knee tarantula.  Had I been in her Keen shoes, I would have run screaming out of the building.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-6/DSC_0520(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>Tarantula</figcaption></p>

<p>We saw giant elephant and hercules beetles and learned how to distinguish beetles from cockroaches (beetles have flying wings covered by hard shells called elytra).  Butterflies filled four greenhouses corresponding to the zones they inhabit.  There was an interesting exhibit on leaf-cutter ants.  No word on whether Alan decided to inject himself with tarantula poison.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-6/DSC_0909(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>Lunch at Cafe Amigos</figcaption></p>

<p>Afterwards we headed back to the Hummingbird Gallery (thanks, Kate). Many more photos came out of this venture.</p>

<p>We stopped at Cafe Amigos right in the &ldquo;downtown&rdquo;.  There was a bunch of gringos there so we didn&rsquo;t expect great food.  But we were pleasantly surprised.  Soda-quality food plus a couple of excellent local Pilsen beers for $14.  Dessert (tres leches cake) was next door.  All the while it started raining hard.  One of the options was to go ziplining, but we had to rule this out on account of weather.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-6/DSC_0925(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>The way from Monteverde</figcaption></p>

<p>So down the mountain we went.  The dirt road from Monteverde was in much better condition than the one we took to get here from Arenal.  On Highway 1, we stopped by a road-side fruit stand to pick up a pineapple and some mangoes. These would give us the chance to put to use the knife we had acquired earlier. The GPS took us on a detour to the Pacific coast.  Turned out it was a blessing, because we got the chance to stop by a black-sand beach.  Highway 27 looked brand-new and took us through spectacular scenery.  This drive would have to be repeated at another time.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-6/DSC_0932(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>Black-sand beach near Puntarenas</figcaption></p>

<p>As expected, San Jose was a maze to navigate.  After checking in, we headed out for an Argentinian restaurant recommended by the guidebook. It was only 6 blocks away, but the way through the warren of downtown streets was dark and somewhat sketchy (though in retrospect no sketchier than certain Boston neighborhoods).  The steak, again, was excellent.  I&rsquo;m please to report that we have not been disappointed by our dining experience in Costa Rica.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monteverde and the adjoining town of Santa Elena are, surprisingly, well-paved.  This may come as a surprise to those who trudged up the bone-rattling gravel road to get here. Despite the lack of easy access, it&rsquo;s quite popular with tourists, 200000 of whom make it here each year according to the guidebook.  As a consequence, quite a few locals speak excellent English.  The climate is also very pleasant compared to the lowlands.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-5/DSC_1099.jpg" />
<figcaption>Let me out!</figcaption></p>

<p>The jewel of Monteverde is the Cloud Forest Reserve.  It is the best known tropical cloud forest in the world.  So we made it our first destination.  I had been here in 2009, when a torrential downpour cut our hike short.  This time we wanted to see more.  The trail wound around what seemed like a tropical Garden of Eden.  The canopy was so thick that sunlight didn&rsquo;t make it through.  We saw a group of hikers clustered around a big tree.  All of a sudden, a leg appeared through a slit in the tree trunk and tried to wiggle out of it.  Someone was inside the tree!  It was explained that this was no ordinary tree but one that had taken root in the forest canopy and grown downward on top of another tree, using it for support while it grew to the ground.  The victim tree eventually died and rotted away, leaving a holllow trunk.</p>

<p>As we walked by a glade, we saw a flash of turquoise feathers trailing two long tails.  Kate got very excited and mentioned something about &ldquo;kettle&rdquo;.  We kept our eyes and ears wide open at that point.  Soon after that we spotted the mysterious bird, likely a companion of the one we had seen earlier.  This one was a less flamboyant female sans the twin tails, but still hauntingly beautiful, almost mythical.</p>

<p>We heard thunder for the entire 4 hours we were in the cloud forest, but nothing came out of it.  On the way back we heard rustling sounds in the tree top!  I spotted a white-faced monkey staring right at us. Unfortunately he was extremely agile and bugged out before we could get another good look.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-5/DSC_0370(2).jpg" />
<figcaption>At the Hummingbird Gallery</figcaption></p>

<p>On a whim we stopped by the Hummingbird Gallery right outside the entrance to the reserve.  Several dozen feeders hung from the branches, surrounded by a multitude of buzzing, darting hummingbirds.  This must be what it feels like to hit the jackpot. Unfortunately, again it was quite cloudy and dark. Without a faster lens I wasn&rsquo;t able to get great shots of these beautiful birds.  Hopefully we could go back, pretty please?</p>

<p>We parked the car &ldquo;downtown&rdquo; and walked a block to Morpho&rsquo;s Cafe, which was recommended by the guidebook.  It was hard to miss thanks to the gigantic statue of a blue morpho butterfly outside the entrance.</p>

<p>Next stop was the ranarium.  Our guide, Walter, was clearly passionate about amphibians.  He spoke great English and even knew some German and Dutch.  I&rsquo;m not really into toads and frogs, but it was fascinating to learn from someone who knew so much about them.  Walter, we learned, tried to build immunity to the poison of the poison-dart frogs by purposely injecting himself with small doses of the same stuff. &ldquo;We crazy biologist guys&rdquo;, he said.  Not surprisingly, he hung out with another guy who tried to do the same thing with snake poison.  The red frog with blue legs we had seen in Arenal turned out to be a so-called &ldquo;blue-jean frog&rdquo;.  Its poison causes paralysis, but is not usually lethal to humans.  The last frog was the green tree frog, which is also the national symbol of Costa Rica.  It wears 6 bright colors.</p>

<figcaption>Green tree frog</figcaption></p>

<p>Our fellow tourists at the ranarium were a Belgian/Dutch couple from Stokkem, Belgium named Peter and Cindy (hi guys!)  We started talking and comparing notes.  Turned out they had been touring much of the country, zipping back and forth from coast to coast.  We met up over dinner later at a seafood restaurant.  Peter was quite a jokester.  They had some interesting stories to tell, ranging from being guided by a brilliant Canadian biologist named Ross Ballard who was particularly susceptible to tropical insects to attending an illicit &ldquo;ping pong&rdquo; show in Bangkok.  From them we learned about the live tarantulas at the butterfly garden.  If we hadn&rsquo;t planned on going there before, we were sold at that point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Breakfast included blackberry and papaya juice. I love this place! We bid farewell to our avian and reptilian friends. There was some commotion on the other side of the dining hall. Our waiter, like other Ticos always eager to point out cool things to us gringos, motioned us to come over. There was a caiman sunning himself just on the other side of the river. He also gave thumbs up to Monteverde&rsquo;s ranarium and butterfly garden; even though he had never been to Monteverde, he learned about them from the hotel&rsquo;s tour leader. Later on we would concur.</p>

<p>Next stop was going to be either the spectacular Catarata Rio Fortuna, or a wildlife refuge. I&rsquo;ve already seen the former and the phrase &ldquo;wildlife refuge&rdquo; was like trigger words for Kate, so the decision was easy. Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge is in Los Chiles, roughly 70km straight up Highway 35. The road was very good, courtesy of the US Army Corps of Engineer who built them in the 1980s to support the Nicaragua Contra War. The road ran through endless plantation lands, mostly pineapple but also some other crops we couldn&rsquo;t identify.</p>

<p>Los Chiles is almost right up against the Nicaragua border. We followed vague signs to end up at the &ldquo;harbor&rdquo;, which was really just a small dock. While there were lots of colorful river boats being moored, this must not have been peak season because we were the only tourists around, gringo or non-gringo. A Tico who must have been some sort of coordinator moseyed over. He didn&rsquo;t speak any English so more broken Spanish ensued. We inquired about the &ldquo;barco&rdquo; and he wanted $80 total for a 3-hour boat tour. &ldquo;Mas barato?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Sesenta?&rdquo; &ldquo;(Thinking) Ok, setenta&rdquo; &ldquo;Sesenta cinquo?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bueno&rdquo;. We were told to pay about $4 for some sort of municipal fee to another guy who sat a small desk by the bathroom. He also said, &ldquo;I watch your car&rdquo;. Good to hear!</p>

<p>Our guy got on the mobile and told us to wait for &ldquo;el capitán&rdquo; who were to arrive in 10 minutes. Not long after a boy who looked no older than 14 pulled up on his mountain bike. They had an exchange and the kid went down to a boat tied up at the dock. We looked at each other. The captain! We paid the guide about 33000 colones, using an exchange rate that was a little high but which made it easier to pay in cash.</p>

<p>Our kid captain was particularly adept at locating things we wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed. He would slow the boat down and pull up to some bush, motioning and speaking in staccato Spanish. Luckily we didn&rsquo;t have to resort to the phrasebook, but only looked at what he was pointing. This river is known to be teeming with wildlife and we were not disappointed. Soon we spotted anhingas, also known as snakebirds for their long, snake-like necks, prehistoric-looking kingfishers, some sort of ibis, green geckos, herons and caimans! Dark shapes with dangling arms high among the branches turned out to be howler monkeys taking a nap. We even saw some humans, swimming in caiman-infested water. Yikes. Gradually we also got better. Kate spotted a caiman lying among some logs which the captain completely failed to notice. We cut the trip short after 2 hours because there was still a long trip ahead, but we saw plenty.  Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t try the chilies in Los Chiles.</p>

<figcaption>Lunch in a soda</figcaption></p>

<p>Driving back the way we came, we decided to grab a late lunch in La Fortuna. Bypassing the fancy restaurants with English names, we went to a soda at the edge of town. It was pricier than the other soda we went to, but the food was excellent. We each had 2 glasses of fresh mango juice. I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of this stuff.</p>

<p>The sun was going down around 5pm, and the specter of driving to Monteverde on rugged terrain loomed large. The drive along the Lake Arenal at sunset was beautiful, but we got to Tilaran as fast as as we could on paved road. Rather than reaching Highway 1, we decided to cut across to Monteverde. On my last trip, the worst road I drove on was that to Rincón de la Vieja National Park. This road was just as bumpy and the darkness made it worse. It was also so steep in some places that we had to downshift to first gear. A couple of times the road looked like it was washed out, with water rushing down a big jagged hole in the middle. My mind went through visions of the car plunging over a steep, pitch-black cliff. Still, the little Suzuki that could managed to pull through. We made it to Monteverde with all the pieces in tact, albeit with a numb lower body.</p>

<p>Everything in this resort was huge. The ceiling on the ground floor must be 30 feet high. We had dinner in a cavernous restaurant and wondered whether the Coopers made it over the mountains.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I lay awake at night pondering how we were going to see more critters.  As it turned out, we didn&rsquo;t even have to leave the hotel.</p>

<p>Tilajari Resort sits right on the bank of the San Carlos River.  We woke up to the chattering sounds of birds.  As we ambled to breakfast we could see the brown river glimmering just beyond a gently sloping lawn.  The fruit section at breakfast was par excellence.  It consisted of freshly squeezed tamarind and passion fruit juice, watermelon, pineapple, papaya, and an unidentified fruit.  The unknown fruit was in a thick rind with a hard, brownish orange outer shell and a fleshy inner part.  The fruit looked like clumps of gooey fish or frog eggs.  The seeds were crunchy and slightly bitter.  I&rsquo;m a fan of trying everything at least once.  However, when it came to this mystery fruit, once was enough. The rest of breakfast was decidedly less exotic, though I found out that 1) I still had a taste for  fried plaintains and 2) Lizano went well with everything.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-3/DSC_0560.jpg" />
<figcaption>Breakfast @ Tilajari Resort</figcaption></p>

<p>I soon caught on to the fact that we were not alone.  The dining hall has no walls and opens right onto the lawn.  The management had wisely staked long bamboo sticks just beyond the open side, onto which they hung remnants of the fruit we were having for breakfast. Needless to say the birds had a field day, and so did I.  However, there was something else.  Long gray-brown shapes were moving on the lawn.  Soon they crept right up to us.  Despite acting like semi-tame house cats, these iguanas looked downright prehistoric.  Our waiter tossed one some papaya chunks and it tried to get its mouth around them, exposing a thick, fleshy pink tongue.</p>

<p>We ran into the Coopers at breakfast.  Looked like they got the same package we did.  Mr. Cooper complained about the drive up, which took them 5-6 hours.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-3/DSC_0598.jpg" />
<figcaption>Volcán Arenal</figcaption></p>

<p>Again I was completely preoccupied with the birds and iguanas, until I was gently reminded that we still had a volcano to explore.  Volcán Arenal is Costa Rica&rsquo;s best known volcano, with the classic and immediately identifiable conical shape. The drive to took us through La Fortuna, which was teeming with tourist traps.  We scampered right through it and made a beeline for the Arenal Hanging Bridges.  The steel-cabled suspension bridges let you walk among the tree tops.  Needless to say, the view of the wildlife and landscape from above was spectacular.  There was some steep sections, so the refreshing cascades at around the mid-way point was particularly welcome. Along the way we encountered lizards, a couple of poison dart frogs and quite a few birds. We saw some kind of finch bouncing around in the bushes like a maniac, all the while making a loud clucking sound.  A local worker pointed out to us an eyelash viper, which we would never have discovered by ourselves.  Last time I was here, we even saw a sloth.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/costa-rica-3/DSC_0638.jpg" />
<figcaption>Arenal Hanging Bridges</figcaption></p>

<p>For lunch we decided to skip La Fortuna and head for Nuevo Arenal, a village which was formed when the original village was submerged during the creation of Lake Arenal in 1973.  The drive along the lake was quite pleasant, with the water one one side and an alternating landscape of jungle and hilly pastureland on other. The guide book recommended the German Bakery.  We didn&rsquo;t even bothered with the GPS, as there were giant road signs reminding us about the place every 5km.  The place was as advertised; i.e., mostly Teutonic.  We had bratwurst, goulash and apfelstrudel for dessert.  The last time I had goulash was in Vienna.  While this incarnation was better, it was &hellip;still goulash.  I guess I&rsquo;m not yet a fan of Central European cuisine.  Across the street was a convenience store whose proprietor claimed to speak English, Spanish, German and Persian.  How convenient!  We picked up a very good knife at the supermarket for $1.</p>

<p>Finally some relaxation after two travel-heavy days.  For dinner we came back to the Tilajari Resort, because it was still the best we&rsquo;ve had until that point.  Grass-fed beef, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s for dinner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Winter dragged its feel longer than usual this year. The first day of spring came and went, yet the dreariness continued well into April. There was even a minor snow storm on April Fool&rsquo;s Day, bringing to mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fool's_Day_Blizzard">epic blizzard of 1997</a>. I remember that one well, having worked through the night to finish a problem set, only to find that class had been canceled and normally busy Memorial Drive had turned into a white graveyard. But winter must go; celestial mechanics ensures of it.</p>

<p>With the warmth came the myriad of tiny buds and the gradual greening of hitherto bare and lifeless branches. Then seemingly overnight, it happened.  Riotous explosions of color covered the trees, carpeted the ground and dotted the otherwise drab front yards. With the transformation of the landscape and the Bruins thick in the middle of the Stanley Cup playoffs, there is no better season than the spring (although the autumn accompanied by the start of the hockey season is a serious contender, losing out only because it is all too brief).</p>

<p>There is really no best single place to go enjoy the spring, because it occurs all around you. Here are some springtime pictures from various places in and around Boston.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We discovered Marblehead sort of by accident.  Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of it from an obscure television series in the late-80s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marblehead_Manor">Marblehead Manor</a>, which happened to star the then-equally obscure Michael Richards.  One weekend we decided that it was too early to call it a night, so we took off on a drive out of Boston in a general northeasterly direction.  We found ourselves at Revere Beach, which was deserted, and continued on Route 1A north to Lynn.  At Nahant we weren&rsquo;t able to find any easy access to the ocean front, so we did the natural thing and kept on driving.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/52804626/images/CordobaGreatMosque-300x223.jpg" alt="Great Mosque of Cordoba" />
<figcaption>Great Mosque of Cordoba</figcaption></p>

<p>At the end of Route 129 we ended up in Marblehead.  It&rsquo;s in a sort of cul-de-sac from which there is nowhere to go but to turn back the way we came (or continue on to the Atlantic Ocean).  Even at night, the town was very attractive.  We drove by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Hall_(Marblehead,_Massachusetts">Abbot Hall</a>), whose exterior ornamentation reminded me of the interior of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral%E2%80%93Mosque_of_C%C3%B3rdoba">Great Mosque of Córdoba</a>. That night we resolved to return.</p>

<p>Marblehead is another of the picturesque seaside towns that dot the New England coast.  The town lays claim to being the birthplace of the American Navy.  This doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise.  Because of its location and excellent natural harbor, the ocean has always been its way of life.  Many houses in the old town bear the distinction of having belonged to a former sea captain, sailor or fisherman back in the 17th century.  It must be what it&rsquo;s like to live in a museum.</p>

<p>We walked on the winding, narrow streets, visited the old cemetery and toured the now abandoned Fort Sewall.  Across a narrow isthmus on a small island (i.e., a &ldquo;neck&rdquo;) is the somewhat small Marblehead Neck Audubon sanctuary. All in all, it was a pleasant Sunday out.  On the way back, we decided to go on another whim and found out about marvellous Lynn Woods, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time.</p>
