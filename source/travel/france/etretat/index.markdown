<h3>The Colossi of &Eacute;tretat</h3>

Our coastal tour of Normandy en route from F&eacute;camp to Le Havre took us to &Eacute;tretat. This village is best known for the two rock formations standing like colossal guardians on both sides of its pebbly beach. Forget the Colossus of Rhodes, meet the Falaise d'Aval and Falaise d'Amont. A footpath running along the coast from the village to the top of both cliffs offers the best vantage points, but unfortunately we didn't have the time to do it. The day's excursion was a washout thanks to the miserable weather. We returned to the east (in the vicinity of Rouen) via Le Havre and the brand-new Pont de Normandie, which cost a cool 5 Euros just to cross.
