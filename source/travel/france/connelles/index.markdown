<h3>Romantic Connelles</h3>

Connelles was our "homebase" in Normandie. Even though it was a tiny morsel of a town, it was no less romantic, thanks in no small part to the fact that it was home to the dramatically named C&ocirc;te des Deux Amants, the "Coast of Two Lovers". The town snuggles against a gentle bend of the Sein, and is covered in the lushness of gardens and farms.

Our neighbors were mainly English vacationers, who made the short hop across the channel, I suspect, to take a break from the nice English weather. I can't blame them really :)

The C&ocirc;te des Deux Amants owes its name, as expected, to a lovelorn young couple. I don't remember the exact details, but I am sure your vivid imagination can fill them in :)
