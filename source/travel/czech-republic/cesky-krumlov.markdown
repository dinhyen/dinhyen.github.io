<h2><em>Postcard-perfect</em></h2>

The view of the castle from high above on the hills of the Vysehrad neighborhood is superb. This spot is about 30 seconds from Pension Vila Vysehrad where I stayed.

The striking red rooftops of Cesky Krumlov, here seen from the castle, is one of its magnificent appeals.

Faded sign on peeling wall along Pivovarska street. For me this is the ideal of old Europe.

<h3>View from the castle tower</h3>
The highest vantage point in the town provides a 360 degree view of the town and the surrounding countryside.

<h3>View from Vyšehrad</h3>
Initially I wished I had stayed in the more popular center part of town instead of the more remote Vysehrad neighborhood. However as this scene spread out below me while I was walking to town (a 10-minute downhill hike), I stopped doubting.

<h3>The castle tower</h3>
The brightly painted baroque castle tower is the most visible structure of Cesky Krumlov's skyline and accounts in no small part for town's surpassing loveliness. You can climb the wooden staircase to the top of the tower for a panoramic view of the splendid rooftops and the Vltava river below.

<h3>Alley wanderings</h3>
If you're in love with narrow, winding cobblestoned alleys, you'll find them here too.

<h3>Castle gate</h3>

<h3>View from the castle</h3>

The castle commands a strategic vantage over the river valley below. Come up here for a spectacular view of the red rooftops and you'll instantly fall in love with Cesky Krumlov.

<h3>The main square</h3>

Cesky Krumlov is tiny. The Main Square is the center of activity. You can probably explore the entire central area in about 15 minutes.


<h3>Rooftops of Český Krumlov</h3>

As at every other place we visted, I was afflected with a severe case of shutter happiness here :) 

You would be too.

This aqueduct-like structure is the bridge leading from the castle to the garden.
