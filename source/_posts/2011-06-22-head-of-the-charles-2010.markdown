Every season in Boston has its own riveting appeal.  The fall is not only the most beautiful of seasons, but it also marks the start of the hockey season and, for non-hockey fans, the annual Head of the Charles Regatta.  In 2010, the Regatta took place on a chilly weekend in late October (this was Boston, after all).  For me, there was nothing better than to put on a warm jacket, hop on the bike for the half-hour ride to Harvard University, then snap away.
