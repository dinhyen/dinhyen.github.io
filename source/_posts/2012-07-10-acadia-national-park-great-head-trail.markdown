Great Head sticks out like a polyp from the southwest corner of Mount Desert Island. Its exposed location means that there are great views up and down the entire length of the island. Unfortunately its proximity and easy access to the ever popular Sand Beach also means that the likelihood of running into flip-flop-wearing, towel-toting, rubbernecking tourists who have never seen the inside of a trailhead is quite high. Nevertheless, the chance to admire the landscape of craggy cliffs carved into by innumerable bays and inlets and pounded by the relentless waves is well worth the risk.  For me, Great Head brings back memories of Point Lobos Reserve in Carmel, California.
