In the autumn of 2010, a few friends and I spent a weekend in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and another in the Berkshires, Western Massachusetts.  The former was a bit more adventurous.  We went on a hike on <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=27909">North Moat Mountain</a> and underestimated the terrain  (or overestimated our ability).  Even though we're decent hikers and were appropriately equipped, 8-9 miles of strenuous hike coupled with a late start were our undoing.  We found ourselves still on the trail when darkness fell and ended up being rescued by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Service.   Thanks a bunch, guys.

Here are some photos from those trips.
