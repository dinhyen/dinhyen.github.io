Some time ago I saw a poster of doors.  No, not [these doors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors).  I decided that I wanted one for myself. I picked [Beacon Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill,_Boston), a historic neighborhood known for its elegant houses and stately mansions.  I biked around at dusk purposely so that the lights would be on, stopped frequently and snapped away.  Some people, predictably, were wary of a stranger taking pictures of their homes.  However, once I explained what I was doing, they were quite understanding.  One lady even offered to turn on the porch lights so I could see better.  It took a couple of days to collect enough photos to assemble into a montage.  Here it is.
