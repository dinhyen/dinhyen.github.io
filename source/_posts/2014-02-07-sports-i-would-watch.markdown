...if I had an unlimited amount of free time, bathroom breaks and no desire to have a life.

1. Olympic men's hockey
1. Bruins hockey
1. NHL hockey
1. IIHF tournament hockey such as the World Juniors
1. Top-flight European professional hockey (KHL, Swedish Elite League, Finnish Elite League)
1. Olympic women's hockey. It's enjoyable but less exciting than the men's game due to the lack of strong competition; basically it's a 2-horse race between Canada and USA. Also there's no checking and it's slower.
1. College hockey
1. AHL hockey
1. High school hockey
1. Tour de France
1. Other Summer and Winter Olympic sports
1. Bandy. I've never seen this Swedish specialty, but this hockey-soccer hybrid is tantalizing. Putting the players on skates is one way to make soccer more exciting.
1. Pick-up hockey in a rink or on a pond
1. Roller hockey
1. Canadian shinny
1. European indoor roller hockey.  They play on rollerskates.  Seriously.  I've only seen it a few times.  It's exciting and weird.
1. Figure skating
1. Midget/Bantam/Squirt/Mite hockey.  Midget is an official youth hockey designation, it doesn't mean the game is played by midgets, Borderlands-style.
1. Midget hockey, Borderlands-style
1. Street hockey
1. A couple of guys practicing with sticks and puck
1. Soccer
1. Volleyball (not beach)
1. Tennis

... and many sports later

Football  
Basketball  
Baseball
