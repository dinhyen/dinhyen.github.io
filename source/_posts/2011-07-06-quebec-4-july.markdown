Last morning in Québec. We took a 5-minute walk to check out the cool murals we saw earlier. These are quite amazing. A Gothic church exterior. An ornate stained-glass interior with a mysterious figure hooded in black. A ancient Aztec-meet-Egyptian structure surrounded by jungle. The best one yet was a castle with a red dragon, unfortunately obscured by the scaffolding for the Cirque de Soleil.  I think you'd agree that these undoubtedly are the coolest highway underpasses anywhere.
