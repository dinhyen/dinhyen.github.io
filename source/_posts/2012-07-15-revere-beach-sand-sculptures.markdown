The annual [Revere Beach sculpting festival](http://reverebeachpartnership.com/sandsculpting/) concluded over the weekend.  But since it hadn't rained, we figured there's a good chance the sculptures were still around.  We got there around twilight, which was even better because the absence of mid-day shadows allowed the subtle details of the sculptures to come out.

Commemorating the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park.

This half-man, half-snake creature (Cobro?) could be the stuff of your worst nightmare.

This is oddly tame considering the wildly fantastic ...beings around it.

This is the back...

...and the front. The title: *Everyone has a dark side*.  This gal would get a lot of dates online, though.

Cyclops is weeping.

*Mother Earth in pain* is perhaps inspired by [Death Becomes Her](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104070/).
