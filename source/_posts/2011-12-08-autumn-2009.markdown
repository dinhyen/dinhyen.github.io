Few places in Boston are as beautiful as [Mount Auburn Cemetery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Auburn_Cemetery). While it is famous as the final resting place of many luminaries with connection to New England, its more enduring legacy is as a green urban jewel.  It would not be a stretch to invite comparison to Central Park.  While not as popular, Mount Auburn is certainly more than an equal in aesthetic appeal.

With its winding trails, rolling hills, hidden glades, spectacular overlooks, stunning sculptures, and brilliantly designed landscape, Mount Auburn is a worthwhile destination at any time of year.  It is most attractive in the autumn, during which it is my favorite destination to view the foliage in Boston.  I usually  make several pilgrimages here every year from around mid-October to early November. These are some photos taken in 2009 at Mount Auburn and nearby Arlington.
