The tallest peak in Acadia and the first place in the continental US to see the morning light, Cadillac Mountain is also the most accessible -- you can just drive there.  Nevertheless, its popularity doesn't detract from its appeal.  Unfortunately we couldn't make it here early enough for sunrise, being worn out from hiking every day. So we had to settle for the "other golden hour".  Fortunately with a storm brewing in the distance all afternoon, we were treated to a beautiful sunset.  Our preferred viewing location is the Blue Hills Overlook, which is the last turnoff just below the peak. From here we can get a view of the setting sun unobstructed by the tree line.
