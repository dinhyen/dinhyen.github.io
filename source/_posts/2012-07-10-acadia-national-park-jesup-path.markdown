Along with <a href="http://www.yentran.org/blog/2012/07/acadia-national-park-dorr-mountain/" title="Acadia National Park: Dorr Mountain" target="_blank">Emery Path</a>, Jesup Path is another trail which can be found at the Sieur de Monts spring area. Straight and level, it's hardly a challenging hike.  Its claim to fame, I think, is an eternity of boardwalk amid a picturesque forest of birch trees and tall grass.
