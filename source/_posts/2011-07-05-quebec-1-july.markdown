We decided to take off around 16:00 on Friday.  In addition to the rush hour, we anticipated no fewer than 100000 Bostonians to be on the move for the long weekend. So we avoided the main highways altogether.  Our plans worked, and when we re-connected with Interstate-93 North it was in Manchester, NH, some 60 miles away. The drive through the magnificent White Mountains was quite pleasant, as usual. Nevertheless, it was to be a very long drive.  My car's GPS has no coverage for the Québec region, so from about Drummondville onward it was driving the old-fashion way.  We made it to the B&amp;B in the St. Roch district around 23:30, not bad despite my reputation as an alleged slowpoke.
