  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a first-generation Nexus 7 tablet made by Asus which ran KitKat 4.4.  When the OTA Lollipop update became available, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to install it.  The latest and greatest Android running on Google hardware seemed to be a match made in heaven; it would be better, prettier and faster, right?  As you can probably guess from the title of this post, the answer was a resounding <em>no</em>.  Everything became sluggish, swipes would only registered after a couple of seconds, random things popped open and close.  The tablet was downright unusable.</p>

<p>Rather than splurging for a new tablet, which was probably what Google wanted me to do, I opted to go back to KitKat, since the hardware itself was perfectly fine.  The <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">process to restore the KitKat system image</a> using the ADB command-line tool that accompanies the Android SDK was quite simple.  I had some difficulty to get my Windows 7 machine to recognize the Nexus 7, until I installed the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html">Google USB drivers</a>.  Alternatively, I could have ran ADB on a Mac, for which USB drivers wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary.  An important part of the process was to make sure I chose the correct system image.  For a Nexus 7, the KitKat image was &ldquo;nakasi&rdquo; 4.4.4 (KTU84P).  The image archive contained a flashing script that I executed after unlocking the bootloader.  The whole thing took about 5 minutes once everything worked.</p>

<p>So with its brain transplanted with a fresh KitKat image, the Nexus was back to its own happy self.  Unfortunately, the good feeling didn&rsquo;t last long.  In short order, Android started notifying me that the 5.0 system update aka Lollipop had <em>already</em> been downloaded and ready to install.  There was no way to dismiss the notification or tell it to remind me again in, oh, never.  The helpful notification sat in the system tray and just generally got in the way.  This is by far one of the worst instances of nagware-ism.</p>

<p>To disable the system update notification, I had to root Android.  Fortunately at this point there were a few mature tools that make doing so quite simple.  I used the <a href="http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt">Nexus Root Toolkit 2.0.4</a>.  Since I was on a fresh install of KitKat, all I had to do was to 1) unlock the bootloader, and 2) root.  The toolkit also installs a couple of useful tool such as SuperSU and BusyBox Installer.  The latter lets you grant root privilege on-demand to any app that requests it.</p>

<p>The next step was to turn off the system update notification service.  There are a few apps, the one I used being DisableService.  Once I navigated to the Google System Service node, System Update Service was already disabled.  Hmm, clearly that wasn&rsquo;t it because there was still a big fat notification in the system tray.  It turned out that I had to go to the Google Play Services node.  Lo and behold, there was another System Update Service.  Disabling this one and restarting the device did the trick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have a problem with Angular scope variable binding not working on a Jekyll or Octopress (which uses Jekyll) page?  It so happens that Jekyll&rsquo;s Liquid Template uses the same  syntax as Angular and would attempt to process the markup before Angular can get to it.  To get around the problem, you can surround Angular markup with <code>&#123;% raw %&#125;</code> and <code>&#123;% endraw %&#125;</code> tags.  Alternatively, you can also forgo from using this syntax altogether and use Angular&rsquo;s <code>ng-bind</code> directive to bind a variable to a DOM element.</p>

<time datetime="2014-04-15T20:05:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 15<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Copying files somewhere is pretty standard procedure when deploying an app.  Interestingly I&rsquo;ve never had to copy files directly in Hudson.  Until now I&rsquo;ve only deployed .NET apps in Hudson and used MSBuild&rsquo;s Copy task to copy the files to a share folder.  Now that I want to deploy Angular and other client apps in Hudson, I&rsquo;d have to copy the files manually.</p>

<p>My initial attempt was to add a new Execute Shell build step to run <code>xcopy</code>.  Since Hudson executes the command through the Bourne shell, which interprets any backslash in the path as the escape character, I&rsquo;d have to escape the backslash itself.  Why Windows has to be different from everyone else is a major source of annoyance if you have to move back and forth between Windows and *nix.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>xcopy c:\\source\\app\\* \\\\server\\share\\app</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This worked, but in order for xcopy to copy subdirectories, refrain from prompting everytime it needs to overwrite a file and take other actions necessary for unsupervised execution, I needed to specify additional parameters.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>xcopy c:\\source\\app\\* \\\\server\\share /c /k /e /r /y /exclude:c:\\source\\xcopy_exclude.txt</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Unfortunately this was when xcopy blows up with the &ldquo;invalid number of parameters&rdquo; error.  It probably had to do with the shell not passing the parameters to xcopy.  No dice if I put the command in a batch file then executing it.  Ditto when I tried <code>robocopy</code>, which prints a nicer error message but is functionally the same as xcopy.  As a note, you could test all of this in a Bourne shell rather than invoking Hudson every time.</p>

<p>It occurred to me to use something that&rsquo;s native to the shell, rather than trying to get it to play nice with xcopy.  You&rsquo;d still have to deal with the backslash in the share:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cp -r /c/source/app/* \\\\server\\share</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This worked!  Also for things like &ldquo;rm -rf&rdquo;.  We&rsquo;re done, right?  Well, this mixmatching of different command-line styles seems unwieldy.  After I experimented further, it turned out that I had made an error from the start.  In addition to the Execute Shell build step, there&rsquo;s another type called Execute Windows Batch Command.  This build step allows you to run commands in a Windows shell.  Thus you can run execute xcopy, or anything else, as you would in the command prompt without needing to escape backslash.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to be able to specify the share folder at run time so the project can be deployed to different servers.  In my initial attempt, I created a drop-down list parameter for the server name.  Then I figured to use the following xcopy command which incorporates the SERVER parameter.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>xcopy c:\source\app\* \\%SERVER%\app</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The %SERVER% syntax is used to reference an environment variable in Windows.  This approach turned out to be an abject failure.  It turned out that entire share has to be specified as an environment variable; e.g., %SHARE% should point to \server\app.  Then I could issue commands such as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>del /s /q %SHARE%\*
</span><span class='line'>xcopy c:\source\app\* %SHARE%</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The benefits of a wired home network are many.  I use the <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/prime">SiliconDust HDHomerun Prime</a> network TV tuners to watch cable TV on any computer in the house without the need for a set-top box.  However, it is quite bandwidth-intensive and even a wireless-N connection just doesn&rsquo;t cut it.  The picture would be plagued with stutters, pause and artifacts and pretty much unwatchable, especially for hockey with its lightning-fast actions.</p>

<p>For wired connectivity without an existing Ethernet network there are three options.  The best option from both cost and performance standpoints is available if the house is wired for a land line with Cat-5/5e/6 wiring, which is invariably the case with a modern construction.  In this case you can just repurpose the existing wiring and swap out the RJ11 telephone jacks for RJ45 Ethernet jacks.  This requires a bit of manual labor but the results are beautiful and satisfying.  I did this for a previous residence and it worked wonderfully. Unfortunately in my current house the wiring leaves something to be desired.  The phones lines are not wired point-to-point but daisy-chained together; this rules out an Ethernet network.</p>

<p>The second option is to use the power lines themselves, which hopefully every house comes equipped with. I used a pair of TP-Link AV500 Nano power line adapters.  Installation couldn&rsquo;t be any easier&mdash;plug them into the power sockets and they just work. The LAN connection is automatically detected in Windows and OS X.  My tests showed that the connection was able to achieve the the full bandwidth that I am supposed to get. My TV feed no longer stuttered or became corrupted. Unfortunately this solution isn&rsquo;t perfect either.  Under heavy load the adapters had a nasty habit of tripping the circuit breakers.  I couldn&rsquo;t even run the network speed test while Windows Media Center was playing without bringing the power down.  Since the powerline adapters don&rsquo;t play nice with surge protectors I don&rsquo;t really have a way to prevent it from happening.</p>

<p>This leaves the last option, a home network over the coaxial cabling, which like most American household we have plenty of. Each room has one coaxial outlet, or even two. The industry standard for a home network over coaxial cabling is the Multimedia over Coaxial Alliance (MoCA) standard.  It seems to be a relatively young technology as there aren&rsquo;t many products for it. Interestingly this is something I&rsquo;m already using as a Verizon FiOS subscriber.  Verizon uses MoCA for the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) which converts the optical fiber signal to electric signal. To use the coaxial cabling to carry Ethernet network traffic requires a MoCA network adapter or bridge, which converts between the different signal formats. I have the standard <a href="http://www.actiontec.com/189.html">Actiontec MI424WR router</a>, which has a built-in MoCA adapter.   It would act as one endpoint.  For each additional endpoint, I would need a separate MoCA network adapter. There are only a handful of MoCA network adapters, the most popular of which the <a href="http://www.actiontec.com/251.html">Actiontec ECB2500C</a>.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure about the best way to set up the MoCA network.  The MI424WR router can connect to the ONT via a coaxial or Cat-5 cable. In my case the MoCA WAN comes into the router via the coaxial connection. However, since the router has only one coaxial terminal, I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I could connect to the MoCA LAN using the same coaxial terminal. I thought that since the router is connected to the MoCA WAN coaxially, I would need an additional MoCA adapter for each outgoing connection from the router to the MoCA LAN.  This possible setup is shown in the below figure.  I would need 4 MoCA adapters to extend connectivity to 2 rooms.</p>

<p><img src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/moca-home-network/moca-bad.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fortunately, this scenario isn&rsquo;t necessary.  It turns out that the router can connect to both MoCA WAN and MoCA LAN through the same coaxial connection. This is because the respective networks operate over different frequency bands and do not interfere with each other. I would only need a MoCA adapter at each receiving end.  Since I can use the router as a MoCA adapter in one room, I&rsquo;d only need one additional MoCA adapter.</p>

<p><img src="http://yentran.isamonkey.org/gallery/moca-home-network/moca-good.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you need more than one Ethernet port, Adaptec also makes a 4-port Home Theater Coaxial Network Adapter (ECB3500T01), which is only marginally more expensive than a 1-port adapter.  It would be a more compact solution than using an Ethernet switch with the 1-port adapter.</p>

<p>Of note, the cable splitter must be MoCA-compatible. Since MoCA operates in the 0.5-1.65 GHz frequence band, the splitter should be rated for at least this range. Fortunately there are many inexpensive options.</p>

<p>Update (Oct 9, 2014): It turns out that Verizon sells a Verizon-branded <a href="https://teleproducts.verizon.com/fileshare/plm/brochure/ATWECB3000N_brochure.pdf">Fios wireless network extender</a> for $75 which comes with 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports as well as Wireless-N and MoCA connectivity, ostensibly to extend a home network to hard-to-reach places.  In retrospect the Wireless-N Wi-Fi extender would have made it a better purchase than the 4-port Home Theater Coaxial Network Adapter.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2014-03-03T15:16:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 3<span>rd</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Developers are lazy by nature and always look for ways to avoid having to perform repetitive tasks. There are plenty of options when you&rsquo;re working with conventional server-side platforms.  Unfortunately, when it comes to JavaScripts and CSS, automation tools are harder to find. That is, until Grunt comes along (following Node, which turned upside down the whole idea of server vs client side in the first place).</p>

<p>As a self-described &ldquo;task runner&rdquo;, Grunt is powerful and pleasantly approachable.  Its succinctness makes it a joy to use.  This carries over into the Grunt documentation, which is really excellent.  Inspired by the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile">Sample Gruntfile tutorial</a>, I&rsquo;d like to walk through my own <code>Gruntfile</code> created for a <a href="https://github.com/dinhyen/darkbox">small JavaScript library</a>.  The goal is to automate a typical process of building the app, from generating CSS from Sass, aggregating various source files into a single file, and minifying the result.</p>

<p>Once you <a href="http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt">have Grunt installed</a> using the Node Package Manager, you will need a <code>package.json</code> file, just as for other Node utilities.  The quickest way to create a <code>package.json</code> file is to simply run <code>npm init</code> which generates the file after a series of questions.</p>

<p>The following libraries will be used:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass">grunt-contrib-compass</a>: generates CSS from Sass</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat">grunt-contrib-concat</a>: combines various files into a single file</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin">grunt-contrib-cssmin</a>: minifies CSS</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint">grunt-contrib-jshint</a>: combs through JavaScript and flags errors or usage issues</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify">grunt-contrib-uglify</a>: mangles and minifies JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">grunt-contrib-watch</a>: performs tasks whenever a file changes</li>
</ul>


<p>The recommended approach, as stated at the beginning of the documentation for each plugin, is to run <code>npm install grunt-contrib-xxx --save-dev</code>, which has the dual benefit of installing the plugin and also adding a reference to it in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Besides <code>package.json</code>, the only other file you need is <code>Gruntfile</code>, in which you define and configure the tasks to run. Configuration options are specified as the argument to <code>grunt.initConfig</code>.</p>

<p>The first line reads in <code>package.json</code> and turns it into an object.  In this case, I&rsquo;m interested in product name, but it can provide <a href="http://package.json.nodejitsu.com">many other useful properties</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">pkg</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">grunt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readJSON</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;package.json&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All <code>Gruntfile</code> tasks share the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks">same basic syntax</a> for specifying options, input and output.  Each task&rsquo;s configuration block is named after the plugin; for example, the configuration block for the <code>grunt-contrib-uglify</code> is simply <code>uglify</code>.  Each task can have arbitrary targets.  You&rsquo;ll probably see a &ldquo;test&rdquo; target for testing or a &ldquo;dist&rdquo; target for building a distribution.  Since I want to build CSS and JavaScript, here I have 2 targets, &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; and &ldquo;stylesheets&rdquo;.  When there are multiple targets in a task, each target can be executed directly.  For example, <code>grunt concat:scripts</code> runs just the &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; target.  If you don&rsquo;t provide a target, then all targets would be run in order.</p>

<p>The Compass task generates CSS from Sass source.  Of course, Compass <a href="http://compass-style.org/install">must be installed</a> first.  The following options simply instruct Compass to process Sass files in the directory &ldquo;sass&rdquo; and generate the corresponding CSS files in the directory &ldquo;css&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When developing, it would be nice to be able to preview changes made to the Sass source.  This is where the watch plugin comes in.  In the simplest use case it simply detects that one or more files have been changed and then runs certain tasks.  The following options allow me to re-generate CSS each time a Sass file is modified.  Start watching by typing <code>grunt watch</code> at the command prompt.</p>

<p>Typically JavaScript and CSS source is distributed over multiple files.  In production you&rsquo;d want to combine the various source files into a single file for performance reason.  This can be done with the concat plugin.  For the source, I&rsquo;m using a globbing pattern for simplicity; <code>src/**/*.js</code> means all <code>.js</code> files in the <code>src</code> directory and any of its sub-directories.  The files would be combined in alphabetical order. An alternative would be to specify an array of individual files.  While this lets you control the ordering of files, it becomes unwieldy for a large number of files. Of course, there are <a href="http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns">many ways</a> to skin the cat.  For the output, I&rsquo;m using the project&rsquo;s name which comes from <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>The cssmin plugin provides CSS minification.  The source should be the output of the concat stage.  Note the variable substitution syntax.</p>

<p>The uglify plugin is the JavaScript equivalent of cssmin.  It also mangles variable names which reduces file size further at the expense of readability.  Since mangling pretty much makes your JavaScript indecipherable and impossible to debug, you can also provide a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">source map</a> which lets you view the original, non-uglified source when debugging.  The uglify plugin have all these and sundry options.  Here it also inserts a comment with some basic information at the top of the file.</p>

<p>To run a task, simply specify the task&rsquo;s name as a argument to <code>grunt</code> on the command line; e.g., <code>grunt jshint</code>.  Simply typing <code>grunt</code> runs the default task.  Below is the output for running the default task; even for this small set of tasks, running them manually or maintaining a script without Grunt would have been a tedious chore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Il me parait que nous avons les même ou presque les même idées sur la notion d’amitié.  Celles-ci sont les idées qu’un ami est quelqu’un avec qui on a des gôuts en commun, avec qui on aime passer du temps, qui on s’entend très bien, sur qui on peut compter, en qui on peut faire confiance, qui n’hésite pas à l’aider aux moments difficiles, ou qui respecte les opinions de l’autre et qui partage ses opinions sans hésitation.  Mails je pense qu’il existe une différence entre nous.  Pour les Francais il existe deux catégories, les amis et les copains.  Pour les Américains, il y a aussi quelques catégories, comme &ldquo;friends&rdquo; ou &ldquo;acquaintances&rdquo;, qui peut être l’equivalence pour &ldquo;copain&rdquo;.  Mails généralement, la démarcation entre les catégories n’est pas très claire. Un copain est quelqu’un avec qui on peut échanger des salutations à la classe le matin.  On a tendance à appeler quelqu’un un ami quand on lui parle souvent, même si on ne le connait pas très bien.  De même façon, on est prêt à considérer un étranger un ami après l’avoir seulement  rencontré quelques fois, bien que peut-être il ne soit pas un bon ami.  Il y a un concept appelé &ldquo;making friends&rdquo;.  Quand on va quelque part, on essaie de dialoguer et rencontrer plusieurs personnes pour s’adapter; on essaie de ne pas être seul.  Dans un cas radical, il y a des personnes qui se rencontrent sur l’Internet et qui considérent l’autre un ami, même s’ils ne se rencontrent jamais en face!</p>

<p>Sur le forum, il est clair que pour vous il y a une grande distinction entre un ami et un copain.  Par exemple, pour vous les autres étudiants en classes préparatoires peut-être sont votre copains parce que vous ne les revoyez plus après, bien que vous les rencontriez souvent.  Pour nous, les camarades de classe sont souvent notre bons amis, précisément parce que nous les rencontrons tous les jours.  C’est mon impression que les Américains sont un peu plus ouverts à l’egard d’amitié.  Comment pensez-vous de cette vue?  Elle est d’accord avec l’auteur Caroll.  Selon elle, les enfants américains sont encouragés à &ldquo;jouer avec d’autres enfants du même age&rdquo; ou à &ldquo;apprendre à entrer en relation avec des étrangers&rdquo;.  Est-ce que les parents français encouragent leurs enfants à faire comme ça?</p>

<p>J’ai un deuxième commentaire sur l’éducation d’enfant en France et aux E.U.  Je suis d’accord avec l’auteur que les enfants français devraient se comporter bien dans la société, donc ils apprennent les notions de discipline, de respect, d’être responsables. En revanche, les enfants américains ont plus de libertés dont leurs parents croient qu’ils ont besoin pour explorer, pour se dévélopper, pour s’epanouir.  Elle a raison, mais selon moi ce n’implique pas que les enfants américains sont laissés tout faire!  Au moin, la notion de politesse est un élément très important dans l’éducation des enfants américains.  Par exemple, les mots &ldquo;merci&rdquo; et &ldquo;s’il vous plait&rdquo; sont les plus accentués, comme &ldquo;les mots magiques&rdquo;, par les parents.  Ce n’est pas très étonnant que les Américains, les enfants et même les adultes, utilisent ces mots très souvent.  Ce n’est pas étonnant aussi que les Américains sont expertes dans les entreprises de service, dans lesquelles la politesse et l’attention pour les clients sont très importants.  On peut généraliser les principes fondamentaux, mais l’actualité est souvent plus compliquée.  Je suis d’accord avec Matthieu, qui a remarqué que les relations entre parents et enfants, françaises ou américaines, dépendent de la personnalité des parents, de leur conviction sur l’éducation, ou de la façon dont ils ont été élévés.À l’egard d’éléver un enfant, je pense qu’il est préférable qu’on l’aide et l’influence au lieu de le forcer à faire quelquechose.  En revanche, on doit intervenir quand il va faire mal et, si nécessaire, je crois qu’on peut le gronder ou lui donner une fessée. Surtout, il est essentiel de lui donner les occasions de s’explorer.  On devrait l’encourager à découvrir lui-même ce qu’il aime, ce qu’il veut devenir, ce qu’il veut étudier à l’université, etc.  Bien sûr, on devrait l’encourager à suivre une bonne voie ou à choisir un bon métier, mais toujours on l’encourage à avoir l’indépendance de pensées et d’actions.  Par exemple, l’enfant voudrait devenir une artiste; même si ses parents désireraient qu’il devienne un médécin, ils le soutiendront encore.  Les parents sont les conseillers et aussie une autorité. Je pense que c’est un aspect très positif de la philosophie d’éducation américaine, parce qu’il est probable que l’enfant sera heureux dans la vie.  Il parait que le système français est plus rigide, dans le sens que l’enfant doit obéir aux désirs des parents.  Est-ce que c’est vrai ou faux?  Pensez-vous que l’indépendance de pensée est importante pour les enfants? Selon l’auteur, les parents français et leur manière d’éducation de leurs enfants sont soumis à un &ldquo;test&rdquo; par le reste de la sociéte.  Trouvez-vous naturel si les autres donnent conseil aux parents pour éduquer leurs enfants ou les reprimandent?  Je pense que l’éducation d’un enfant est une affaire très privée.  Je saurais quand mon enfant n’a pas de comportement acceptable.  Je serais prêt à recevoir les conseils de la famille ou d’amis, parce qu’ils auraient les désirs sincères, mais je ne pense pas que les jugements de l’autre soient appropriés.</p>

<li>NHL hockey</li>
<li>IIHF tournament hockey such as the World Juniors</li>
<li>Top-flight European professional hockey (KHL, Swedish Elite League, Finnish Elite League)</li>
<li>Olympic women&rsquo;s hockey. It&rsquo;s enjoyable but less exciting than the men&rsquo;s game due to the lack of strong competition; basically it&rsquo;s a 2-horse race between Canada and USA. Also there&rsquo;s no checking and it&rsquo;s slower.</li>
<li>College hockey</li>
<li>AHL hockey</li>
<li>High school hockey</li>
<li>Tour de France</li>
<li>Other Summer and Winter Olympic sports</li>
<li>Bandy. I&rsquo;ve never seen this Swedish specialty, but this hockey-soccer hybrid is tantalizing. Putting the players on skates is one way to make soccer more exciting.</li>
<li>Pick-up hockey in a rink or on a pond</li>
<li>Roller hockey</li>
<li>Canadian shinny</li>
<li>European indoor roller hockey.  They play on rollerskates.  Seriously.  I&rsquo;ve only seen it a few times.  It&rsquo;s exciting and weird.</li>
<li>Figure skating</li>
<li>Midget/Bantam/Squirt/Mite hockey.  Midget is an official youth hockey designation, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the game is played by midgets, Borderlands-style.</li>
<li>Midget hockey, Borderlands-style</li>
<li>Street hockey</li>

<p>The routes definitions specify the Angular controller and HTML template to use when the user navigates to a particular path.  Here we have 2 controllers, one for the index page and one for the details page.</p>

<p>The index controller retrieves the task list as a JSON array via the <code>$http</code> service:</p>

<p>The index view renders each task with a link which embeds the task&rsquo;s id.  When clicked, the link redirects to the task&rsquo;s details view.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s pretty run-of-the-mill.  But let&rsquo;s say the task list also contains sufficient data to show each task&rsquo;s details (the index page simply displays fewer information due to space constraint).  There&rsquo;d be no need for a separate request to pull data for the details page.  The details controller can just search in-memory, within the task list which is already retrieved.  However, since each controller has its own scope and can&rsquo;t access another&rsquo;s scope, there has to be another way to share data between controllers.</p>

<p>Enters the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope">root scope</a>, which acts as the parent scope for all other scopes.  If a property can&rsquo;t be found in a scope, Angular searchs its parent scope and so on until it reaches the root scope (as a consequence of prototypical inheritance).  Putting the task list in the root scope would allow Angular to find it in the index controller and, because all scopes share the same root scope, also allow the details controller to access it.</p>

<p>Modifying the index controller to save the task list to the root scope:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Instead of making an HTTP request, the details controller can search for a task by id within the root scope.  When it finds the tasks, it saves it to its own scope.  It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to not pollute the root scope any more than necessary.</p>

<p>Each time the user returns to the index page, a fresh request is made to retrieve the task list.  I could optimize it further by retrieving the task list only if it has changed.  To do so, I&rsquo;d need to keep track of the modification time.  Here, I&rsquo;m only making the simple check to see whether the task list has already been populated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A requirement recently came up to update the primary key of a SQL Server table.  We get user data from a third-party single sign-on service and store them locally.  When the SSO software was upgraded, user IDs were changed, so we need to update our local users but retain existing data.  I suppose one way to do so would be to drop any existing foreign-key constraint and update all related tables.  Unfortunately, the User table is related to practically every other table in the schema. Updating a bunch tables manually, without the safety net of relational integrity, would be a bit dodgy. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a less painful approach using the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186973.aspx">ON UPDATE CASCADE</a> clause.</p>

<p>In a simple example, I have a LineItem table, whose <code>userId</code> field references User&rsquo;s <code>Id</code> field. Since the existing FK relationship doesn&rsquo;t have ON DELETE CASCADE, I&rsquo;d have to &ldquo;alter&rdquo; the constraint to add it.  But because is no &ldquo;alter contraint&rdquo; in T-SQL, I&rsquo;d have to drop and re-add the constraint.</p>

<p>Thereafter when I update an Id in the User table, the change would be cascaded to LineItem and all other related tables.</p>
