  <h3>Day 1: Getting our feet wet</h3>

<p>Kauai is the back end of our 2-week stay on the islands. Flight time from <a href="/travel/usa/hawaii/hawaii/index.html#2013">the Big Island</a> to Honolulu was only about 1h, and to Lihue took just an additional 20 minutes.  Getting out of the airport we ran into heavy traffic on Highway 56, the only highway on the east side of the roughly circular isle.  Turned out there was an accident involving a motorcyclist which was unfortunately fatal. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that tragedy might have been avoided if more motorcyclists here wear a helmet.  It seemed as if everyone on the island knew about the accident.  The car rental agent knew about it, so did the shuttle driver and the hotel clerk.  We made a quick pit stop at Princeville market, where apparently no shirts and no shoes are no problem.  This store is great.  They carry poke, locally grown pineapples, locally made ice cream and seem to promote local products.  They also charge for (paper) bags&mdash;an excellent idea.  I&rsquo;m thinking about the Market Basket at home where shoppers come out with dozens of bags, all plastic, which most likely end up in a landfill or worse on the streets.</p>

<h3>Day 8: Sleeping Giant Mountain</h3>

<p>Kauai is synonymous with an exotic tropical paradise.  No wonder so many movies have been filmed here.  We were last here only in 2010, but we loved it so much that it wasn&rsquo;t at all a difficult decision to come back.  We&rsquo;re staying in Princeville in the rugged North Shore, where glorious views can be had just by looking up from wherever you are.</p>

<p>This being our first full day here, we were happy just shopping for food and lounging around.  In the afternoon we went for a hike at Sleeping Giant (Nonou) Mountain in Kapa`a.  Went up the East Side Trail, which is 1.8 mile long.  A fit person can go up in about 1 hour.  We ran into a few locals who live at the bottom of the mountain and go up to the top every day.  This trail is wide and gentle in spots, yet in others requires scrambling with 500-foot drop on either side.  At the &ldquo;top&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a hut with benches.  The view is very good here, but that&rsquo;s not all.  A sign posts warns that this is the end of the trail and you shouldn&rsquo;t go further.  However, the trail does go on further, up a narrow ridge (the neck?) to the head of the supine giant.  After a short but steep scramble you&rsquo;ll get to the face of the giant at around the nose area.  The view is 360-degree and breathtaking in every direction.   From here you can continue on to the forehead, or gingerly step along an even narrower ridge, with perpendicular drop-offs, to the chin area.  From here there is nowhere else to go, just take a deep breath and enjoy the vista.  You can see the Wailua river, fields and houses of right below, the beaches, the undulating hills sloping up to the green mountains in the distance.  One of the locals actually found a hidden spot where she said she likes to meditate.  The vertiginous will probably not enjoy it here, but for others it would be one of the most spectacular spots on Kauai, and that&rsquo;s saying a lot.</p>

<h3>Day 9: Wailua Falls</h3>

<p>Every day we woke up to a glorious view of green serrated ridges.  Impossibly high up the ridges are the tantalizing silky strands of a waterfall. There is little chance we can hike up to it, so we have to admire it from here.  It can be hard to leave because you get such a spectacular viewpoint without going anywhere.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s hike took us to the vicinity of yesterday&rsquo;s hike.  From Highway 56 in Kapa`a we turned onto Highway 580.  In short order we arrived at a scenic viewpoint for Opaeka`a Falls.  Cross the road and you get a nice view of the Wailua river.  We drove almost to the end of the road, just before Keahua Arboretum, and parked at the trailhead for Kuilau Ridge trail.  This is one of the most scenic trails on the island,  impressed as we were with yesterday&rsquo;s hike up Nonou Mountain.  The wide, gently sloping path took us up the ridge, and while there was no spectacular payoff at the end, we were constantly rewarded with breathtaking views of the surrounding valleys.  Gigantic koa trees line the path, and fallen leaves provide a nice carpet to walk on.  There are unfortunately plenty of the invasive strawberry and lemon guava trees.  There are also lots of flowers.  After about 1 &frac14; mile we reached a plateau with a picnic shelter.  The view from here is expansive. It is practically under the shadow of the Makaleha Mountain.  As good as the view here was, once we continued descending from the other end of the plateau it got even better.  The trail follows a ridge with deep gorges to both side.  Everything is covered in lush, intensely saturated shade of green you get on Kauai.  The trail ends at a large wooden bridge where it meets the Moalepe Trail.  The latter iss less scenic and considerably more muddy, so we turned back here.</p>

<p>After just two days of hiking our minds were appropriately blown, and we haven&rsquo;t even returned to the famous Kalalau trail or Waimea Canyon yet.</p>

<p>Next stop is Wailua Falls.  We came here last time, though the twin falls which makes an appearance in the intro credits for Fantasy Island is so accessible it&rsquo;s worth the short drive.  The 4-mile drive on Highway 583 also provided a welcome breeze.  The road ends at a parking area right above the falls.  Most people craned and tilted their camera in an effort to get a better view of the bottom of the falls.  Our guidebook reports that it&rsquo;s 180 feet high, more than Niagara Falls.  The ancient Hawaiian purportedly leaped off the falls to prove their manhood.  The guidebook also mentions 2 ways to reach the bottom of the falls.  However, the authorities have fenced off the area around the trailhead nearest to the falls and put up warning posts.  I decided to head to the other trail, about &frac14; mile up the road.  Just behind the guard rail and yet another warning post is the trail head.  This was a very steep &ldquo;trail&rdquo;, as expected, with no handhold except for exposed tree roots.  After 15 minutes of hair raising descent I reached the bottom of the gorge and made it to the river.  However, after some difficult bushwhacking I reached an impassable area on the river bank.  I had no choice but to turn back, but unexpectedly spotted an almost completely hidden waterfall on the cliff wall.  Walking back to the parking area, I ran into someone who came up the other trail.  To get there, you had to climb over the fence. So many people had done it that it was bent and crooked.  This trail is shorter and no more steep than the other, but muddy and slippery.  After 15 minutes I reached the pool at the bottom.  This is a much better view of Wailua Falls than above.  The twin cascades make a thunderous roar as they dive headlong into the a deep green pool, sending clouds of spray high and wide.  The adventurous can go around and behind the falls for a closer book.</p>

<p>In Kapa`a, we stopped by Pono Market, which has the best <em>poke</em> on the island (we also sample their fare on our last visit).  Poke is a heavenly fusion of Hawaiian and Japanese cuisine.  In the old days the Hawaiians were already eating fish raw.  Japanese immigrants brought with them preference for tuna and introduced soy sauce.  Nowadays it&rsquo;s most often made with cubed ahi tuna marinated with sea salt, soy sauce, pepper, onion, and sesame oil.  Other ingredients are also mixed in&mdash;we&rsquo;ve had roe, limu seaweed, algae, wasabi and avocado.  Poke is sold practically everywhere, even Costco carries them, for around $11-16 per pound.  Until now I&rsquo;ve had them almost every day.  Some days I practically subsisted on poke and pineapple, another local staple.  I must have had almost 10 pounds of poke so far and probably enough mercury to make a thermostat.  We choose the locally sourced poke whenever possible; it&rsquo;s concerning that world-wide ahi tuna is considered near threatened.</p>

<h3>Day 10: Kilauea Lighthouse, Ho<code>opi</code>i Falls and Hanalei</h3>

<p>We wanted to try the Okelehau trail in Hanalei, just down the road from where we were staying.  However, it rained early and stayed cloudy, so instead we headed for the Kilauea lighthouse where we stopped briefly yesterday.  The lighthouse is part of Kilaulea Point National Wildlife Refuge.  Here you can walk to the lighthouse, which is being renovated after being in service for more than 100 years.  We saw _nene_s hanging out by the side of the road.  Sea birds dotted the cliffs overlooking the lighthouse and many more circled overhead.  We saw red-footed boobies, albatrosses, frigate birds and tropicbirds trailing their pretty red or white streamers.  This is also a good spot to observe the Hawaiian monk seals; we saw some basking on the beach below the lighthouse on our last visit.  In the winter months, humpback whales migrate here for the mating season.  There are binoculars for borrowing in the visitors&#8217; center.</p>

<p>After this we headed to the mountains, where there wouldn&rsquo;t be rotund tourists schlepping around in flip-flops.  I&rsquo;m a sucker for waterfalls, so we made straight for Ho<code>opi</code>i waterfall in Kapa<code>a.  It's surprisingly accessible.  As soon as we came down the hill into Kapa</code>a, we turned onto Mailihuna Road, which merged onto Kawaihau Road, then turned right on Kapahi Road, a quiet residential street. Our guidebook warns that residents are not altogether happy about speeding tourists, so we pretty much crept down this street and parked on the side near a dirt trail on the left.  Just a short walk took us down to the chocolate-colored Kapaa Stream.  Keep walking.  There&rsquo;s a spur trail leading to the first waterfall, which is more of a small plunging rapids.  There are plenty of side paths, but we stuck to the well-worn main trail which more or less parallels the stream.  It was a fairly easy walk, through some spots would be treacherous if it had rained.  Soon we entered a stretch of forest of tall, stately trees thick with climbing vines.  The ground is covered with ferns and other green plants, dappled with sunlight that manages to make it through the dense overhead canopy.  The stream seemed even more serene in its gently curving banks.  This is one of the prettiest jungle walks anywhere.  The trail emerges from the forest and hugs a cliff side.  About 0.8 mile from the trailhead we came to a spot where we could look down on the second waterfall.  The stream widens here and a solid wall of water comes thundering down on top of the bedrock.  The flow is much more violent and turbid than usual, perhaps appearing more so thanks to the muddy water.  On the left side is a smaller horsetail falls.  We scrambled down a steep and slippery path to the water&rsquo;s edge.  We had the falls to ourselves.  As we came up we saw a few locals coming down, dressed for a swim.</p>

<p>On the way back to Princeville, we stopped by a road-side fruit stand and bought some lychees.  There are many fruit stands along this stretch of road.  Enterprising locals also put up home-made signs along the curb.  We got some great local-grown fruit, as well as some exotic fruit that are hard or impossible to obtain fresh on the mainland.</p>

<p>It was now mid-afternoon and we weren&rsquo;t ready to call it a day yet.  It was an unusually warm day, so we decided to head back to the Okelehau trail.  This trail is extremely easy to get to.  Soon after the &ldquo;Taro fields&rdquo; Scenic Point and immediately after we crossed the single-lane bridge in Hanalei, we turned left down the first road.  This took us down the middle of the taro fields we had seen from the Scenic Point.  After 0.75 mile there&rsquo;s a parking area on the left and a bridge on the right.  The guidebook warned that this is a grueling hike and it was right on the money.  The initial stretch through dense undergrowth was wet and muddy.  As soon as it began to dry, it began to rise.  And rise.  We&rsquo;ve never seen such a continuous and relentless stretch of climb before.  It&rsquo;s not only the length but also the slope.  It rises at up to a 25-degree angle non-stop, with only maybe 3 switchbacks, for something like 0.7 mile (according to my GPS watch), although it seemed much further than that.  This is a sweat-inducing, thigh-burning hike, with only the cool breeze noticeable once we got higher as respite. There are some native bamboo orchids along the trail which provide welcome excuse to take a break.  At the top of the climb, we reached a power pole which brings electricity to Hanalei far below.  Unfortunately the afternoon sun was right in front of us, so the view was hazy and full of glare.   The trail turns sharply left and ascends the ridge. We saw someone coming down with a bag of red strawberry guava.  We ran into many of this tree on these ridges.  The ripe fruit is quite juicy, if the insides are a bit gooey.  The rind is slightly tart, and you&rsquo;d have to spit out the numerous hard seeds.   The slope is much more manageable, but the trail is narrower and bumpier.  Occasionally we got a view of the Hanalei coast to the right, or a sweeping view toward Princeville and Kilaulea to the left.  At 1.1 mile we reached a flat area with several <em>ti</em> plants.  There&rsquo;re also a USGS marker and a broken green bench.  The unobstructed view of Hanalei is lovely, albeit hazy.  You could see, sort of, the ridge where the highway ends at Ke&#8217;e Beach.  Behind us we could see all the way to the Kilauea lighthouse past the tiny Princeville airport.  The only problem was, this wasn&rsquo;t the advertised view.  We&rsquo;re at only the half-way point, with the payoffs at around 1.7 mile and at the end.  With some reluctance we forged on.  The trail got worse from here.  It was also overgrown in many places, the razor-edged grasses and twigs scratching and clawing at our bare legs.  It also became much steeper and uneven.  At the 1.5 mile marker&mdash;mysteriously we had missed all of the other markers&mdash;we saw a spur trail to the right which according to the guidebook leads to nowhere, so we stayed on the main trail.  Nevertheless, except for a few nice lookouts, we didn&rsquo;t seem to be getting anywhere.  Much of the time, the grasses were just too high for us to get an unobstructed view. It just seemed to be an endless and miserable slog.  I have to admit that after climbing up a long, muddy slope at around 1.7 mile, we finally gave up and turned around.  Sure a marvelous view <em>might</em> await just 5 minutes ahead, but we didn&rsquo;t really enjoy this hike too much.  Perhaps we&rsquo;ve been spoiled by the much more scenic hikes we&rsquo;ve had on the island.  We didn&rsquo;t even regret giving up.</p>

<h3>Day 11: Kalalau Trail</h3>

<p>Today we were to tackle the famous Kalalau trail.  At 11 miles long, it is the only trail to traverse the Na Pali coast.  Otherwise you would need to see it by boat or by air.  Without backpacking, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hike the entire way.  Last time we hiked to the Hanakapiai Beach, only 2 miles in.  This time we resolved to make it the Hanakapiai waterfall, 2 miles from the beach.  We had a late start, around 10h30, and the drive from Princeville to Ke&#8217;e Beach was treacherous, not due to road condition but to the number of cars on and off the road.  From about Tunnel Beach onward, cars are crammed into all available parking spots and whatever remotely resembled a parking spot.  It was like driving to a mall on Sunday.  We were lucky to find a &ldquo;spot&rdquo; in front of the guardrail near the overflow parking area for Ke&#8217;e Beach.  Ke&#8217;e Beach is the end of the road, and it&rsquo;s known for excellent snorkeling.  Luckily most people went no further than the beach.  There were still a lot of people on the trail, but certainly much fewer than on the beach.</p>

<p>The hike would be 4 mile one way.  We cleared our schedule so we really had no timetable.  However, we only brought 1 water bottle each, and this turned out to be a mistake.</p>

<p>The trail rises immediately from the trail head, which is right across from the beach restroom.  It rose steeply but no worse than the Okolehau hike.  But with just hours since the Okolehau death march, our steps weren&rsquo;t as springy as they could be.  Our legs would have their toughest trial yet.  At 0.25 mile we get a nice vista of Ke&#8217;e beach.  The trail is well-maintained, but it hugs the cliff side the entire way so there&rsquo;s always a vertical drop to one side.  Lots of native flora line the sides of the trail, including the <em>hala</em> trees whose fruit resembles a pineapple, and the ubiquitous <em>ti</em> plants.  There are lots of shades provided by large <em>kukui</em> trees and even some avocado trees.</p>

<p>The trail goes up and down, but mostly down from around 0.75 mile.  The view of the razor-sharp ridges of the Na Pali coast diving steeply into the blue-green water was outstanding.  The trail skirts around several lush ravines under vertical peaks.  Every inch of the trails lives up to its reputation as the most breathtaking trail on the island.</p>

<p>At around 1.5 mile we got the first glimpse of Hanakapiai beach.  There was still a long way to go.  Even from high above the surfs appeared very strong.  A sign is labeled with the number of visitors who have drowned.  Ominously, instead of a number there are a bunch of tally marks.  We also saw an emergency helicopter landing pad just above a bend.  The beach is a huge swath of sand.  There&rsquo;s a small cave at the north end.  It is a beautiful beach, but we had set our sights on a bigger fish. After crossing the boulder-filled stream, we made straight for the continuation of the trail.</p>

<p>Just a short way in, we saw hundreds of the yellow sweet guavas on the ground where they burst open.  Their sweet fragrance permeated the trail.  The juicy flesh is fairly good-tasting if a little tart, but the pulp is full of hard seeds.  There seems to be billions of seeds which explain how these trees spread so far and wide.  We also saw some Vietnamese man trees (<em>Syzygium samarangense</em>).  They bear conical red fruit with spongy flesh.  Another familiar tree was the Vietnamese sapoche tree (<em>Manilkara zapota</em>).  But we were most impressed with the gargantuan mango trees.  They are larger than any we&rsquo;ve seen. I would love to be here during mango season.  Even though they&rsquo;re not native to the island, we were certainly happy for the shade they provide.  Several thick bamboo stands intersperse with the mango trees.</p>

<p>The trail mends its way along the stream, crossing it a few times.  It was quite a pleasant walk.  At about 1.75 mile we began to get a view of water tumbling from an impossibly high peak.  The last 0.25 mile is particularly fun with several crystal-clear pools and the constant sound of gurgling water.  The spectacular Hanakapiai Falls is everything you could hope for and more.  The stream drops 300 feet into a deeply green semi-circular pool.  You don&rsquo;t just look up to see the top, you don&rsquo;t even look way up, you&rsquo;d have to look way up then way up from that. After taking a few photos, it didn&rsquo;t take us long to get into the water.  It was the most refreshing and satisfying thing after sweating for almost 2 hours.  Having water falling on your face was particularly fun.</p>

<p>On the way back, I took a wrong turn and ended up crossing the stream too far upstream.  To compound the problem, while I was waiting for my companion, some other hikers made the same crossing and never came back.  There&rsquo;s a trail on the other side which was marked with a red ribbon, but it just dead-ended at the stream.  I must have criss-crossed the other side several times.  I forgot the cardinal rule of orienteering&mdash;when in doubt, back track.  Finally I happened to see a red ribbon across the stream from where the other trail dead-ended and was able to re-cross and pick up the main trail.  That&rsquo;s the other cardinal rule, always look for the marker.</p>

<p>I have to admit the hike back from the beach was brutal.  It kept going up and up, and after each turn, up some more.  I was definitely feeling the effect of the Okolehau death march yesterday and of getting run around earlier.  The water was long gone, and I must have sweated a large percentage of my body weight. The sweat-soaked camera bag and tripod seemed to weigh a ton.  Any thought of conquering the mountain was long gone, it was just about putting one foot in front of the other.   I was thinking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_(whaleship">story of the Essex</a>) and tried to be inspired; it worked somewhat. This was probably the longest 2 miles I&rsquo;ve ever hiked.  Finally I made it down, found the water fountain and drank several bottles.  The lukewarm water was like nectar.  The last hike of the day was the &frac14; mile to the car.  Move over, Okolehau death march.</p>

<p>When we left, most of the cars were gone.  After a pit stop at the market, it was straight home for fresh slices of Hawaiian pineapple and homemade smoothie made from Roselani coconut pudding ice cream and fruit-stand avocados.</p>

<h3>Day 12 &amp; 13: Sprouting Horn and Waimea Canyon</h3>

<p>Waimea Canyon has perhaps the most spectacular scenery on an island that&rsquo;s full of it.  Also known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, for me it&rsquo;s much prettier thanks to its lushness.  From our lodging in Princeville, it&rsquo;s only a short distance away if we could take to the air or water.  In actuality, we had to drive the other way almost completely around the island.  Once you leave the highway at the town of Waimea, there&rsquo;s no straight line for 18 miles to the end of the road at around 5400 feet.  The temperature also dropped from around mid-90s to mid-60s degrees F.  Unfortunately, the quality of the view in this area is highly dependent on weather. Ideally we would be here early in the morning when it&rsquo;s cool and clear.  In the afternoon, even on a nice day, clouds would start to roll in, depriving us of views of the splendid coastline.</p>

<p>On our first day, it started raining heavily as we entered Koke&#8217;e State park, even though it had been completely dry until that point.  As we were up so high, it was quite surreal to drive in mid-day being surrounded by fog and having virtually no visibility.  We could wait it out, but the rain was quite heavy and unlikely to stop.  The precipitation also meant that any hiking would be out of the question.  We stopped by the visitor center for some shopping and headed back to the south coast for some beach view and the Sprouting Horn.</p>

<p>We were determined to see Waimea, so we hit the road again on the second day.  Like on the first day, clouds started rolling in around noon and soon obscured everything.  We went to the Kalalau and Puhi&#8217;a lookouts and had to turn around.  It would be pointless for us to go on a hike on the Na Pali side.  We made a stop at Pu`uhinahina lookout and found that the canyon side was still quite clear.  So we decided on the spot to hike the Canyon trail, which would take us into the canyon.</p>

<p>The trail steeply descends from Pu`uhinahina parking lot for about 0.5 mile, where it meets up with the Cliffs trail.  On our last visit we had hiked the Cliffs Trail.  The trailhead is on Halemanu road, which is 4WD-only.  From the junction it was a short walk to the canyon lookout.  The view from here is excellent, and you can see a part of the Canyon trail on a cliff ahead.</p>

<p>The Canyon trail starts descending into a ravine quite steeply.  Going back up would require much huffing and puffing.  Climbing out of the ravine, we entered a thick forest of native <em>koa</em> trees.  Their slender, wavy pale branches are quite pretty.  Their distinctive sickle-shaped leaves carpet the ground.  As soon as we came out of the forest we started to ascend the ridge.  From here the dizzying heights takes your breath away.  You&rsquo;re on the lip of the canyon, where one side is a unobstructed drop to the bottom 2000 feet below.  From some angles, other hikers seemed to be standing on or walking off the edge.  It was hard to tell distance until a helicopter buzzed by. It looked no larger than a dragonfly.  At the far end, there&rsquo;s a round arch on the cliffs across a chasm.  It looks man-made, but in a location that no man could reach.  On the descent footing was quite difficult thanks to the steepness, the loose soil and the hair-raising perspective.  There&rsquo;s a ditch on the left that makes it easier to go down because you can put both hands on the sides.  The trail comes as close as it can to the edge then curls back.  It&rsquo;s somewhat overgrown here.  At the junction, the left fork takes us to a small waterfall that&rsquo;s slowed to a trickle.  The right fork takes us to an amphitheater-shaped ledge that overlooks the canyon.  That is one of the most spectacular viewpoint anywhere.  We spent quite some time here before heading back.</p>

<p>On the way back, we took a short detour to Poipu.  Just off Highway 56 is the &ldquo;tree tunnel&rdquo;.  There&rsquo;s a small pull-out in the tunnel where we snapped a photo.  Driving through the tunnel was quite cool.</p>
