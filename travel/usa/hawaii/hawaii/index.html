  <h1>2013</h1>

<h3>Day 1: Kailua-Kona</h3>

<p>The Big Island is about the size of Connecticut, but is as large as all the other islands combined. We checked out Kona town, as it&rsquo;s known colloquially. Part of it feels like California but part feels like a different country.  We saw a couple of giant banyan trees, a reproduction heiau (temple) which is the personal heiau of King Kamehameha. We found a Banh Mi Ba Le place but didn&rsquo;t check it out yet. It was Sunday so the former royal palace was closed. We checked out the church across it (Hawaii&rsquo;s first church) which housed a model of the Thaddeus, the ship which carried New England missionaries to the islands.</p>

<p>Here is the start and finish of the famed Ironman Triathlon on Ali`i Drive.  The swim portion takes place in the bay, while the bike portion goes up to Hawi.  During this trip, we saw many road cyclists on the highway between Kona and Hawi, perhaps training for an upcoming triathlon.</p>

<p>We decided against renting snorkeling gears and to buy them so we could reuse them the following week in Kauai.  So off we went to Costco. It&rsquo;s just like the Costco everywhere, with some localized merchandise like surfboard, poke (cubed seasoned raw fish which is my only favorite Hawaiian dish), seaweed salad and the aforementioned snorkeling stuff.  I spent the time reading up on Hilo in the guidebook.  As we headed out we pulled over to a road side stall where a guy was selling home-grown fresh &ldquo;cold&rdquo; lychees for $20/a bag (maybe 4-5lbs).  These are amazing.  We wished we had bought more, but it was his last batch of the season.</p>

<p>Off we went south on increasingly windy road, parts of which felt like Costa Rica. We stopped by the painted church in Captain Cook with some nice murals, like one about the king of Babylon and the proverbial &ldquo;writing on the walls&rdquo;.  We saw only a few other people there.  It was a deserted and peaceful place with a nice view of the ocean.  The only staff was a cat, who was napping. My sister whacked a tall plum tree (Vietnamese plum) and got a bunch.  I saw her doing that and blurted out &ldquo;what the hell are you doing&rdquo; <em>while on church grounds</em>.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s definitely in my future now.</p>

<p>We then went to the famed Pu`uhonua O Honaunau or City of Refuge nearby. This is one of only 2 National Parks on the island (the other being Hawaii Volcanoes NP). The history of native Hawaiians is steeped in somewhat savage (from our modern perspective of course) traditions including human sacrifice and cannibalism.  This sounds straight out of Robinson Crusoe. This area is interesting because it allows a person who commit <em>kapu</em> which is punishable by immediate death to get off scot-free, so long as he makes it to the refuge before he gets caught.</p>

<p>The complex also served the Hawaiian royalty, so those parts were kapu to the commoners.  Ominous kapu sticks serve as a warning to the off-limits area. I suppose if you commit kapu on the royal areas of the complex, all you have to do is make it a short distance to the other side and you&rsquo;d be fine. The most interesting thing are a massive wall, 10-feet high and 17-wide and as long as a few football fields. It&rsquo;s made from volcanic rocks put together without mortar. <a href="/blog/2012/07/31/machu-picchu">Sounds familiar</a>? There&rsquo;s also a gargantuan platform, made the same way, which served as a heiau.  A temple with several fierce carvings contain remains of 21 or so royals.  There is a nice cove next to the temple which served as the private canoe landing pad for royalties.  This is a nice and peaceful area, but which can do without the rowdy restaurant/club next door.  We wait for sometime but it&rsquo;s cloudy, so we decide to GTFO for some sunset.  We drove a loong time.  This is because the speed limit is 35-45mph for most of it.  They seriously need some roundabouts here instead of inefficient traffic lights.  We made it to Apeopukumuhuluamoaku bay-something (everything here is like 25 syllbles long, all vowels) which the guidebook recommends as the best sunset due to the coconut-lined fish pond in the foreground.  But a couple of boats inconsiderately parked right in front of it.  I tried something different but will probably come back again (it&rsquo;s about 6 miles from the hotel in Waikoloa). Before coming home, we stopped at the (expensive) mart (feels a bit like the one in Spain) to pick up some to-die-for Tropical Dreams ice cream.  Mmmm.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t do much today but it felt like we had driven forever.  I desperatedly needed some sleep but ended up getting up in the middle of the night (which was 10h in the East Coast, Hawaii being 5 hours behind) and couldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep.</p>

<h3>Day 2: Kohala</h3>

<p>Today I figured we should hit the beach.  We were staying in Kohala, the oldest of 5 volcanoes making up the island and home to several world-class beaches.  We headed to Hapuna beach, just minutes from the hotel, rated the best beach in the country.  The second-best beach on the island, Mauna Kea, is right next door, and so is the third-best.  The beaches on this part of the coast are sandy&mdash;this is unusual because the island is formed from volcanic eruptions, so most of the beaches are rugged.  The vast swath of sand makes this beach popular.</p>

<p>We got there just after 9 and there were a lot of people, including a company of teenagers who were lining up to do jumping jacks. Later on they would compete in races, padding a surfboard or swimming. Looks fun. Some of these kids seriously need to put on sunscreen.  There&rsquo;s lot of rocks on one of end of the beach, even a lava cave, so we snorkeled here.  Lots of colorful fish and even a turtle were hanging out here.  The water was turquoise green and soothingly warm.  It didn&rsquo;t take me long to get beached out, though.</p>

<p>Originally I was planning on going on beach excursions all day, but since beaching out I decided to change plan and head north to explore Kohala.  In short order we passed through Waimea, the heart of the island&rsquo;s cattle country.  This town is more Northern California than anything, with cowboys in big pickups instead of surf bums.  Ranchland run as far as the eye could see and it was full of black and white cows.  The beef here must be pretty good, but I&rsquo;d still rather have <em>poke</em>.  We drove up the Kohala Mountain Road.  The air was quite pleasant compared to sea level. There was a gentle breeze and it looked like it was going to rain, even though it was bright and sunny on the beach.  On the way down we saw a black shape peaking through the white clouds.  It&rsquo;s Haleakala on Maui, 30 miles away, and the intervening water looked like a puddle.  We couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom due to the haze, but the peak towered over us.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Kohala we found ourselves in Hawi, a refuge from the sugar plantation days. It&rsquo;s still got some factory buildings, but now it&rsquo;s an artists&#8217; colony of sorts.  Per the guide book we tried the Tropical Dream ice cream at the Old Coffee Mills cross from the Bamboo restaurant.  It was packed, probably with tourists reading the same guidebook, but the ice cream was excellent.  I had Kona Coffee and Macademia Nut flavors.  The coffee? $55/lb, but remember Kona Coffee is one of the best in the world.  The tiny town has a large square (for its size) with 2 gigantic banyan trees.</p>

<p>We then headed east to Kapa&#8217;au next door.  We stopped at the civic building, which has a statue of King Kamehameha I.  This statue has an interesting history.  It was shipped from France in the late 1800s, but was lost at sea around the Falklands islands (this was before the Panama Canal opened).  They promptly ordered a copy. Soon after the copy arrived, someone found the first statue, which was then salvaged and put on display in front of a store, like a dollar-store Indian.  The locals purchased it back, fixed the broken arm.  It finally made it to the destination shortly.  The copy was put in front of the legislature building in Honolulu, while the original is displayed here, since the king was born on Kohala. The police station and court house are at the back. The architecture of these buildings, get this, is reminiscent of the royal palace in Hue, Vietnam.  Two giant koa trees, which must be hundred of years old, provide shade and make this place so relaxing. In fact, two people were sleeping in their cars.</p>

<p>The civic building also displayed several posters and newspaper excerpts about local veterans, many of whom took part in WWII. Hawaiians, particularly those of Japanese descent, have a right to be proud of their service to the US.  The 442nd Infantry Regiment, made up almost entirely of Niseis, became the most decorated unit in US military history, even while their families were put in concentration camps at home.</p>

<p>We continued down the road until it ends. Along the way we stopped by a roadside stand and bought a golden pineapple.  It was grown on the spot.  The road ends by a cliff.  It was a weird mix of locals and fresh-off-the-beach tourists. We could see the beach far down below, surrounded by towering cliffs on both sides and verdant Pololu valley.  People walking on the beach looked like little action figures.The trail zigzags down the cliff with breathtaking views of the beach which was being pounded by powerful surfs.  The beach is quite rocky, but the setting is unequaled.  Well, actually it&rsquo;s just the one end of this part of the coast, the oldest on the island, which is full of valleys like this.  Unfortunately it would take too long to see them all.  This isn&rsquo;t even the highlight of the day.</p>

<p>We drove back the way we came.  Past Hawi, we saw lots of wind turbines.  This part of the coast is extremely windy, so it makes sense to put them here, but probably not so close to the airport.  This area is quite dry and somewhat barren, but has a kind of alien beauty.  The trees are stunted and bent into tortured forms by the wind.</p>

<p>We stopped by Mauna Lani, home to a first class resort and incidentally the Puako petroglyphs.  This area has tons of resorts like that.  The petroglyphs are fascinating. No one knows how old they are or made for what purpose.  They were made on volcanic rocks by the ancient Hawaiians.  They were like cave paintings in a sense.  The petroglyphs are great, but the trail itself is amazing.  It winds through a strange forest of spiky trees bent and twisted into tortured shapes. There are no straight lines.  It was like walking through a forest of kelps or angry serpents. Or a scene out of the Brothers Grimm.  It was a singular setting and a perfect home for the eerie figures of the glyphs.  The  trail ends in a vast field of flat stones, covered in hundreds of glyphs.</p>

<p>We lingered by the petroglyphs until just before sunset, then came back to the beach for it.  Unfortunately the clouds rolled in with the rain, so it wasn&rsquo;t as spectacular, but we&rsquo;ve had a good day.</p>

<h3>Day 3: Hilo</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot to do on the west side of the island except for ridiculously nice beaches.  But since we&rsquo;re not beach bums, we decided to head across island to Hilo. Because middle of the island is dominated by volcanoes, there are only 3 main ways to go from coast to coast: to the north on Highway 19, around the barren south island, or directly over the &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.  This is the shortest way, but not necessarily the fastest due to the high elevation and variable weather conditions.  According to the guidebook, it was also miserably paved until recently.  The author also dramatically described one of his drives through here in the middle of the night as the &ldquo;spookiest&rdquo;.  With these in mind, we headed toward the saddle early in the morning.</p>

<p>The drive started out quite nice.  We drove through a rolling carpet of yellow and green as far as the eye can see. We passed by an occasional herd of cows placidly chewing and seemingly having not a care in the world.  This seems like a landscape straight out of the midwest, if the midwest has looming volcanoes and the shimmering ocean far below.  Almost immediately the road starts climbing, gradually at first then quite steeply.   One stretch of it has quite a roller coaster quality.   We couldn&rsquo;t see over the hump so we had visions of the car chase scene from Bullitt.  The road skirts a military training area.  Signs warn motorists of passing military vehicles.  I almost wished they put up a Tank X-ing sign.  The pavement is very smooth and excellently graded.  It goes to show how the lack of heavy traffic, nasty winter and slipshod repairs can do wonders to road quality.  We made pretty good speed and soon were passing by Mauna Kea.  We could see sunlight reflect off the domes of the world-renowned (well to astronomers anyways) observatories on top.  Hopefully another day.</p>

<p>The stretch to Hilo was fun.  For the last 20 or so miles I didn&rsquo;t press the accelerator once.  Our first stop is a Kaumana caves, right on the side of the road. The &ldquo;cave&rdquo; is really just a break in a gigantic lava tube, leftover from the 1881 flow.  The stairs descends steeply into a grotto overgrown with vegetation.  There are 2 large &ldquo;skylights&rdquo;, one on each side.  The entrance was slick from the recent rain, in fact water was still dropping from the overhanging vines.  The opening is large enough for a car to drive through, yet the light struggles to illuminate more than a few feet into it.  We had a feeble flashlight which was better than nothing, but only just.  The cavern is quite tall and spacious, but the only opening at the end is only high enough to crawl through.  A party that came out before us said they&rsquo;d gone for almost &frac12; mile.  We&rsquo;d have to take their word this time.</p>

<p>Next stop is the famous Rainbow Falls, underneath which King Kamehameha was said to have buried his father&rsquo;s bones.  Even though it just rained when we drove, apparently it didn&rsquo;t rain here and there was no rainbows to be found.  The falls drops off over a rocky ledge into a green pool.  Unfortunately water level wasn&rsquo;t very high, the water wasn&rsquo;t a raging cafe au lait-colored mess I remember from our last visit in 1999.  The guidebook warns us of break-in, but the parking lot was packed with tourists so there was little concern.  Further up the trail is a gigantic banyan tree.  Its hundreds of tightly huddle trunks are fascinating to look at.  These trees are everywhere here.  They look so stately during the day, and creepy at night.</p>

<p>We took a short drive up the road to Boiling Pots, passing by what seems like suburbia USA.  Like elsewhere in America, this means a tidy lawn and a chain-link fence.  But there are also giant exotic trees in the yard, flowers everywhere and across the street is a towering, solid WALL of jungle.  This is paradise&rsquo;s version of the subdivision.  We turned into a side street and bam, there was the sign for the state park.  This is literally like living in our house and having a raging river run through the Gibsons&#8217; backyard.  The Boiling Pots looked innocuous enough from the observation platform.  We had trouble finding the trail down, until some people materialized out of nowhere and ducked underneath the railings.  Turned out according to the caretaker they had several fatalities here, 7 in the past 3 years, so they decided to hide the access.  Safety by obscurity.  We headed down the steep trail anyways.  The water level was quite low.  But it&rsquo;s not hard to see that during one of Hilo&rsquo;s frequent rainstorms it could turn into torrents.  The massive bowls are worn smooth from the force of the currents.  We could see Pe&#8217;ePe&#8217;e Falls in the distance and attempted to follow a steep and muddy trail.  It ended quite abruptly above a cliff. So we were forced to take picture of the falls from a distance.</p>

<p>Hilo is a cute little town, with cute buildings and vast picturesque boulevards lined with massive trees and fronted by the ocean.  We made it to Banyan Drive and parked under its shade.  Lili&#8217;uokalani Gardens is a Japanese garden with an enviable beach-front location.  It is very well done.  Its many connected ponds, bridges and little pagodas add a unique touch to a wild and exotic jungle landscape.  Banyan Drive is so named for the many banyan trees that line the curvy avenue.  Almost every tree carries a plaque with the name of the person who planted it.  Many were unknown to us, but some are King George V, FDR, Babe Ruth, Richard Nixon(!).  We took a photo in front of the &ldquo;Amelia Earhart&rdquo;, dated Jan 6, 1935.  We drove down a road parallel to the water, where most of Hilo&rsquo;s beaches are located.  The guidebook praises the west island&rsquo;s world-class beaches, but these are no less scenic.  The surf is definitely rougher on this side.  We tracked down Hilo Homemade Icecream.  In the back is a huge garden with several tents set up.  Turned out they also do camping&mdash;an excellent form of low-cost lodging.  We parked at the beach across from Lokoaka Road.  The hike to the beach runs under a dense jungle canopy, reminiscent of our hike in <a href="/blog/2011/05/30/costa-rica-day-5-saturday-monteverde">Monteverde</a>.  The beach isn&rsquo;t much of one, stacked from top to bottom with black boulders.  A local pointed out a green turtle just sunning himself on the rocks.  We watched him for a while, then he decided he had enough and raised up, clumsily made a 3-point turn like a student driver, then slid into the water with the grace of an Olympic swimmer.</p>

<p>We made a stop at the Pana&#8217;ewa Rainforest Zoo &amp; Gardens.  This tiny zoo on the outskirts of Hilo is no National Zoo, or even Franklin Park Zoo.  But it has a nice collection of birds, clean facilities, is tidy and free.  The star of the show is a white Bengal tiger, born and raised in Las Vegas.  Our favorite is a white macaw that grumbles and mutters.  According to the caretaker, the former owner had him in a workshop and was constantly arguing with his wife.  He can also say his own name.  The several macaws and parrots were also a hoot to watch.</p>

<p>We made the drive to Volcanoes National Park, half an hour away.  As soon as we got out of the visitor&rsquo;s center, it started raining, lightly at first then steadily.  This made any kind of outdoor activities out of the question.  So we stopped at Jaggar&rsquo;s Museum further down the trail, the last stop since half to the trail was closed.  The rain lifted briefly to show us a rainbow over Halema&#8217;uma&#8217;u crater.</p>

<p>We stopped by the popular KLA Superstore in Hilo.  It&rsquo;s Japanese-owned so they had some Asian staples.  We picked up some delicious ahi, clam and shrimp poke as well as Korean BBQ beef. They do something I also see in Europe, that is to charge customer for disposable bags, but give them a small discount for using their own bag. Liked and +1.</p>

<p>During the drive back over the saddle, it&rsquo;s rained continuously since we were at Volcanoes NP.  This came as no surprise since this is one of the wettest place on earth.  Hilo gets something like 240 inches of rain a year&mdash;they comically consider 70 inches of rain a drought condition.  The rain made our drive back quite a slog.  Then we hit the fog.  This was slow going for a while, but we finally got above the clouds and it cleared up to a brilliant night sky.  This is the sky that make astronomers drool to be here.  Then came the roller coaster bit and the descent, once again into the fog.  I could see why it&rsquo;s a spooky drive here.  The narrow cone of light in front of you is all that exists.  In the murkiness even the normal objects can take on fantastic outlines.  If you turn off the light everything would be swallowed by the fog.  Reminded me to put the movie The Fog on my list.  In retrospect today was one of the epic-drive day.  In trying to do both Hilo and the Volcanoes NP, we probably bit off more than we could chew.  There is so much to see on this side that I felt the urge to cram.  Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be back, but focus on just one.</p>

<h3>Day 4: Volcanoes National Park</h3>

<p>Last night our visit to Volcanoes NP was cut short by rain.  We had thought we&rsquo;d be back, so here we were.  Ominous rain clouds hovered over the Hilo area, and we were completely drenched.  However, just a few miles from the park, the clouds gave way to blue sky.  The weather seemed really localized.  Later on, as we drove back, it was rainy in the park yet dry in the vicinity of Hilo.</p>

<p>After the requisite pit stop at the visitor&rsquo;s center, we made a bee line for the Kilauea Iki crater. The guidebook recommends this trail as the best on the island, and it did not disappoint.  The trail takes you along the rim of the crater, last active in 1959, down into the heart of the crater, then back out again at the Thurston Lava Tube parking area.  We tackled the loop counter-clockwise.  On the rim the trail is completely covered by the forest.  Ohia lehua trees, ferns and ginger plants abound.  The air is cool and moist, and the trail dances tantalizing close to the crater&rsquo;s lip, offering glimpses of the black, brown and gray landscape as far as the eye can see below. You really don&rsquo;t have an idea how big the crater is until you see tiny, colorful, slow-moving forms no larger than insects on the crater floor.</p>

<p>The crater is quite something.  It&rsquo;s an alien landscape of jumbled mounds of rocks.  Even the smoothest section undulates like waves. Every so often the ground split open into a dark chasm, not unlike certain California highways after a big quake.  Yet despite the devastation life manages to gain a foothold.  Bushes of plump berries dot the ground.  Most amazing are the ohia lehua trees.  They manage to shoot up through cracks and crevices in the lava and seems to thrive with a dazzling display of brilliant red flowers.  You&rsquo;re not supposed to pluck the flowers.  According to legends, the goddess Pele fell for the handsome warrior Ohia, who was in love with the maiden Leihua.  Pele appeared before Ohia, who turned her down.  In anger Pele turned him into a tree.  The other gods took pity on the lovers and turned Leihua into flowers so that they are forever inseparable.  If the flowers are plucked from the trees, the heavens would be moved to tears and drench the earth.   The trees on the crater floor are small, they could almost be mistaken for bushes.  Yet on the park loop road, we drove under a dense canopy of these trees, so tall and graceful.  No doubt in due time, they will also transform the crater floor into a verdant jungle.</p>

<p>The hike back up to the lip of the crater is considerably less steep and we ended up at the Thurston lava tube.  From amount of cars at the parking area, it seems to be the most popular road-side attraction.  The short hike takes you among the jungle landscape to an opening in the lava tube below.  The park has done an admirable job of trying to preserve and foster native fauna.  Due to its geologic history, the Hawaii islands have had a large number of endemic species.  Contrary to what you may expect, they tend not to be as flashy as the tropical alien plants and trees introduced by human colonizers.  We spoke to a park ranger on Kauai who said they look rather unassuming and unnoticeable.  Yet they are vital to the biodiversity for the forest (and planet) and contribute to the survival of endemic birds and insects.  Some came dangerously close to the brink of extinction, such as the petite alula plant.  So their preservation is vital.  Here and there you see signs with names (scientific, common and if applicable Hawaiian).  There are some areas where invasive plants were being exterminated.</p>

<p>The lava tube was formed when crusts formed over a lava flow.  The extremely hot core remained liquid and drained away, leaving the crust in the form of a tube.  The tube is as large as a subway tunnel, damp from the constant dropping of water percolating through the lava rocks above.  Hanging vines and tree roots grope their way down into the opening.   Just as we arrived, a tour bus dropped off Japanese tourists, who streamed into the tube.  The Japanese have to be the most orderly people I&rsquo;ve seen.  They travel in a single file, talk in low tones and don&rsquo;t loiter around.  Unlike the typical tourists in Hawaii, particularly my casual-to-a-fault compatriots, they are very well-dressed.  Just behind the entrance, the tube continues on for some distance.  However, entrance is now forbidden.  This lava tube was form from the flow of 1881.  Above, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine you&rsquo;re walking above the tunnel; the forest&rsquo;s recovery completely obscures any signs of lava.</p>

<p>We drove down the Chain of Crater Road.  The drive is interesting with many stops along the way at formerly active craters. For the most part, the landscape is similar to other lava flows.  There are many nice hikes in this area, though we didn&rsquo;t have time.  We stopped by the Petroglyphs trail.  A 1-mile hike over uneven lava leads to an area with boardwalk per the petroglyphs.  One remarkable feature here jus the numerous round holes on the lava where the ancient Hawaiians buried the umbilical cords of newborns. Otherwise we thought the Puako Petroglyphs were more numerous and interesting from an artistic viewpoint.</p>

<p>The Road ends rather abruptly.  Here many people went on to see where the current lava flow tumbled into the ocean (and probably got a distant view of steam rising).  You can also find the Holei Sea Arch here, and of course the view of the rugged wave-battered coast line will knock your socks off. The surf was extremely powerful here on the windward side.  The waves made loud booming sound like distant artillery.  Sometimes a particularly strong wave sent spray all the way to the top of the cliff where we stood.  This is truly an awe-inspiring display of the force of nature.</p>

<p>Last time we were out to Hilo, we missed Waiale Falls which is just upstream from Boiling Pots, on the same Wailuku river.  With some light left we decided to swing by it before heading home.  We can see the falls from the bridge.  Not satisfied with the view, I decided to go up a well-hidden trail head.  This couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a pig trail, well-trampled in parts and covered over in others. The guidebook warned of armies of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.  They were mercifully absent, but the numerous grass bushes with razor sharp edges were worse.  Eventually I made it to the cliffs overlooking the falls.  The trail continues on but I decided to turn back with the encroaching darkness.  Despite the wild, unkempt condition of the trail, I was surprised to see taped on a tree trunk is a printed flyer for a lost wedding ring.  You couldn&rsquo;t ask for more Hawaii if you tried.  For all I know, I could have been bush-whacking through somebody&rsquo;s backyard.</p>

<p>The drive over the saddle was much less eventful.  I think I&rsquo;m getting more comfortable with driving on this road, having traversed it twice in each direction.  My main complaint has to do with the speed rating.  The speed limit on the straight-as-an-arrow, wide-shouldered, usually clear 3-lane highway through the highest part of the saddle is 55mph.  The speed limit on the 2-lane, rollercoaster-like, twisted-like-a-corkscrew, no-shoulder, frequently fogged over descent is only 10 mph fewer.  I was flying over the middle at up to, um, many miles over the limit, while over the other stretch I could barely stay on the pavement at the speed limit.  Somebody&rsquo;s estimates are a little off.</p>

<h3>Day 5 &ndash; Hamakua Coast</h3>

<p>Today is the third straight day we&rsquo;ve found ourselves on this side of the island.  We would have preferred the east side, but unfortunately the only lodging we found was on the resort-friendly west side.  This time we took the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; route through Waimea and Highway 19.  Just before Waimea we were greeted by the sprawling Parker Ranch.  The ranch&rsquo;s namesake family traces its root to patriarch John Palmer Parker, who was from Boston and whose family owned the famous Parker House Hotel on Tremont Street.  He was hired by King Kamehameha to cull his herd of long-horn bulls (who were apparently much more aggressive and dangerous than the modern breed).  He married the king&rsquo;s granddaughter and were allowed to buy land on which the ranch originated.</p>

<p>The drive through the Hamakua Coast was lovely.  This area is the lushest on the Big Island, covered in lush tropical forests and laced with numerous waterfalls.  The knife-edge ridges come close to those of the Na Pali coast on Kaua`i.  Forests of eucalyptus trees, straight as a toothpick and all at a uniform height of about 50 meters. When the sugar industries packed up and moved to Central America and the Caribbean, these were grown as part of a plan to produce pulp for paper mills.  Unfortunately their plans fell apart and no one has figured out what to do with these trees. They are nice too look at, certainly better than fields of sugarcane, but nothing compared to a real rainforest with its infinite biodiversity.</p>

<p>We made a stop at Laupahoehoe Point.  There&rsquo;s a large state park there with sweeping views of both coast lines.  Giant surfs pounds the rocky shores.  We saw some of the biggest surfs here since the sea arch at Volcanoes NP. There&rsquo;re even three giant concrete barriers, presumably to block the waves.</p>

<p>We decided to check out the multi-tiered Umauma Falls, which requires an admission fee.  We didn&rsquo;t come here in 1999 so we wanted to give it a shot this time.  The falls are picturesque, but the big attraction here is the zipline, which seems like a recent addition.</p>

<p>Nex stop was Something Tropical Smoothie.  It&rsquo;s the most delicious concoction we&rsquo;ve had anywhere, and the ingredients grew right behind the shop.</p>

<p>After the refreshing pit stop we went down the Old Mamalohoa Highway to the <a href="http://www.htbg.com">Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden</a>.  This is one of the prettiest drives in Hawaii. The winding road is enclosed on all sides by a tunnel of verdure, interrupted here and there by the silky strands of a waterfall.</p>

<p>We love botanical garden, and this is no exception.  While its well-pruned and -manicured landscape is a far cry from the unkempt jungle, its lush green and vivid colors make it as pretty a spot as you will ever see.</p>

<p>The last stop of the day is Akaka Falls.  The drive was different from what I remembered from last time, when we had to park alongside a muddy road.  We drove through a charming little town then through large expanses of fields before suddenly arriving at the Akaka Falls State Park.  Since we arrived so late we had to park outside the gate, as the attendant would be leaving soon after.  With its gentle paved walkway and sturdy railing, this is one of the more tourist friendly attractions.  Usually this is bad sign for us, but luckily there were only a handful of people here.  The trail is a loop and we went counter-clockwise so it took much longer; if we had gone the other way we&rsquo;d have been at the falls within minutes.</p>

<h3>Day 6: Kiholo Bay</h3>

<p>Kiloho Bay is yet another turquoise-colored, palm-ringed beach.  It&rsquo;s also one of the best places to find sea turtles. It was formerly a fish pond built by old Hawaiians for the king.  We got there by exiting right off the highway, though takes a bit of a slog through loose sand and lava pebbles.  Along the shore just inside the tree line is a freshwater swimming holes. Further down the shore, is the beach-front Balinese house.  It was purportedly built in Bali then shipped here and reassembled piece by piece.</p>

<p>We came to a shallow inland lagoon connected to the bay via a narrow inlet. Sea turtles love this spot.  We saw many swam through the channel into the lagoon.  Getting out was a bit tougher due to the strong current.  Since the lagoon wasn&rsquo;t accessible, I took off my shoes and went for a wade, staying wide of the turtles and not disturbing them. Several of them were sunbathing on the far side of the lagoon.  There are some just lounging on the beach and we spot several in the water.  Something about this area, perhaps the abundance of underwater vegetation, really appeals to the turtles. We spent some time here observing the turtles.</p>

<p>Just past turtle city we came to the lagoon with its now-derelict offshore breakwater, formerly part of a fish pond. The lagoon is shallow and tranquil.  We saw people crossing on foot in waist-deep water.  The shore is strewn with mounds and chunks of lava.</p>

<p>Today was our penultimate day on the Big Island, so we took it easy.  We checked out Puako Beach, then headed back to A-bay for sunset watching. Several cats hang out by the tree next to the W/C.  They look happy/lazy/jaded, or perhaps that&rsquo;s just how cats always look.  The trail wanders around the old fishing pond, now off-limits to swimming for preservations, in front of two resorts.  There are several pools which are connected directly with the ocean, but which are supplied through underground water.  The rows of palm trees lining the beach make an excellent back drop for sunset watching.</p>

<h3>Day 7: City of Refuge</h3>

<p>We checked out at 10h and had a flight at 17h30, so we figured we should stay dry and made toward Hilo again, destination Mauna Kea, specifically the visitor&rsquo;s center.  However, reading about it further on the way there, we decided that it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the drive up, especially since we didn&rsquo;t have a 4WD that would take us to the top (or make it easier).  Plan B was Arch City, a collection of lava tubes and arches right by the shore.  To get there, we had to park just up the shore from City of Refuge.  When we were there last time, we saw a large number of people milling about this area.  We had thought it was a gathering or BBQ of some sort.  The same mob was here today, and many of them were bobbing in the water!  We parked and investigated.  It turned out to be a large shallow, crescent-shaped bay with numerous rock formations.  Standing on shore, we could even see yellow shapes moving about underwater.  So the decision to stay dry went out the window.  We had the best snorkeling we&rsquo;ve ever had in Hawaii, this includes the traditional snorkeling hot spots of Kealakekua Bay at Captain Cook&rsquo;s Monument on the Big Island, Molokini Crater on Maui and off Na Pali coast in Kauai.  The coral reefs are spectacular. We saw plenty of yellow tangs, long-nosed butterfly fish, needle fish, triggerfish, parrot fish, even humuhumunukunukuapua`a. A sea turtle struggled in a tidal pool trying to eat the weeds while the waves sploshed him about. Every so often, a family of spinner dolphins swam close to shore and darted among the snorkelers, even acrobatically leaping out of the water as they are known for doing.  All this with the remarkable backdrop of the City of Refuge to boot.</p>

<h1>1999</h1>

<p>For most people, Hawaii is at or near the top of their list of dream destinations. Hawaii invokes images of lush rain forest, white sandy beaches, clear turquoise waters, silky waterfalls, palm tree silhouettes against the sunset, and of course girls in grass skirt and coconut shells swaying to the mesmerizing sound of the steel guitar :)</p>

<p>Hawaii is a land of extreme contrasts. One of the most isolated places on earth, Hawaii is also one of the most accessible tourist destinations, thanks to its status as the 50th U.S. state. Tropical paradise it is, yet snow falls in the winter, forming the perpetual snowcap on top of Mount Mauna Kea. In fact, Hawaii is home to 21 of the world&rsquo;s 22 climate zones.</p>

<p>Hawaii is a chain of islands formed by ancient volcanic activities. The 6 principal islands are Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanaii, Maui, and Hawaii (aka the Big Island). The Big Island was the home island of native Hawaiian royalty. It is also home to the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and several spectacular waterfalls. Kailua-Kona is the largest city, located in the west coast. The middle part of the island is mountainous and unaccessible to motorists. To visit the rest of the island from Kailua, one must drive along the coast.</p>

<p>Kailua beaches are not as good as those on the other islands because they are smaller and usually littered with volcanic rocks. It more than compensates for this with breathtaking sceneries and of course the amazing volcanoes.</p>

<h1>Mauna Kea beach (Kaunaoa bay)</h1>

<p>Mauna Kea is one of the nicer swimming beaches on the island. The wide crescent swath of fine white sand runs down meet the turquoise waters.</p>

<p>Directions: About 30 miles north of Kailua-Kona. The beach is accessible through the grounds of the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel.</p>

<h3>Kahaluu Beach</h3>

<p>In my opinion, the nicest beach on the Big Island. Located just north of Kailua-Kona, this long, shallow beach is perfect for swimming and body-boarding. Snorkeling isn&rsquo;t very good, but there are some good spots at the north end of the beach. There are nice facilities on the beach including freshwater showers.
Directions: Kailua-Kona. Go a few miles north on Highway 19 until you see Alii Drive.</p>

<h3>Akaka Falls State Park</h3>

<p>Diving 420 feet before crashing in a thunderous roar, Akaka Falls is surely an awesome sight to be hold. The grounds around the majestic waterfalls is covered by an impossibly lush layer of ferns. Akaka&rsquo;s sister falls, Honauma Falls, is nearby. The trail picks its way among luxuriant tropical growth, hanging vines, bamboo groves, and wild orchids. you may be tempted to harken back to a time when dinosaurs still roamed the earth.</p>

<h3>Macademia mania</h3>

<p>The Big Island is known for its giant macadamia farms. There&rsquo;s a large one south of HIlo whose name I&rsquo;ve forgotten. You can watch how macademia is collected, processed, and packaged. You can even taste samples in the giftshops. However, it turned out that the products sold here cost just as much as on the outside&hellip; Besides, macadamia nuts are pretty fattening :)</p>

<h3>Pe&#8217;e Pe&#8217;e falls</h3>

<p>A short drive up the road from Rainbow Falls is Pe&#8217;e Pe&#8217;e Falls. Judging from the empty parking lot, it probably doesn&rsquo;t get as much exposure as its downstream sister. But it suits us just fine. The falls is far away, but the vista is breathtaking.
Directions: Hilo</p>

<h3>Rainbow falls</h3>

<p>Rainbow Falls is in the vicinity of Hilo. The thunderous falls can throw up a veritable curtain of sprays, providing the background for its namesake. However it was cloudy when we were there, and no rainbows were visible.
Directions: Hilo
 Rainbow falls is more reminiscent of <em>caf&eacute; au lait</em></p>

<h3>Black sand beach, Punaluu</h3>

<p>South of the Hawaii Volcanoes NP, you&rsquo;ll come across an astounding sight. Black-sand beach&rsquo;s appearance is a result of ocean waves wearing down and crushing volcanic rocks and debris.</p>

<h3>Kealakeua Bay</h3>

<p>Kealakeua Bay south of Kailua is famous (or infamous) as the site where Captain Cook, the legendary English explorer, lost his life in a skirmish with the natives. An monument now stands at the site, although it is inaccessible by car. The best way to get there is to rent a canoe or kayak, put it in and paddle across the bay. You may even see a playful dolphin on the way across. You can also take a tour boat there, but it&rsquo;s certainly not as fun. The waters around the monument is clear and teeming with tropical fish, perfect for snorkeling.</p>

<h3>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</h3>

<p>Hawaii is home to the world&rsquo;s most massive volcano, Mauna Loa, and most active volcano, Kilauea. At the Volcanoes NP, you can get up close and personal with the landscape created by the earth&rsquo;s primal force and, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you can even witness it in action. If you&rsquo;re looking for an explosive eruption like Mount St Helens, you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. Here most likely you&rsquo;ll see slow-moving lava flow more reminiscent of mudslides.</p>

<p>You can walk on the jagged rim of a crater, gingerly pick your steps on the gnarled surface of a lava field, drive along the Crater Drive for a look at the rugged coast shaped by lava flow, or explore a lava tube the size of a subway tunnel.</p>

<h3>Wrath of the gods</h3>

<p>You may be tempted to elope with piece of volcanic rock or a handful of sand for souvenir. Guess what, according to local lores, doing this would arouse the anger of the gods, goddesses and assorted local spirits who would ensure that all sorts of malevolent misfortunes befall you. Obviously too much hassle for a piece of rock. Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>
